There are lots of important things in our life. However, in most cases, they depend on the priorities we have and the acceptation we are awaiting from it. If it fulfils our dreams and aims or not. First of all, let us start with one of the most important things in our life and that is health. Our mind and body will be very satisfied if we give our body at least the minimum of our time. What I am trying to say is that a certain form of physical activity per week is beneficial in many facets of our life. That is to say, if you lead an active life, your body appreciates it when you get older. On the other hand, those who prefer not to have an active life and their efforts to put their time in any kind of activity have a bad perspective when they get older. Moreover, their lifestyle is probably aimed at working and earning money. All things considered, it seems reasonable to revise our free time and to think it over: do we have what we wanted?

When we are talking about travel, we have to reduce our thinking only to the available methods of transportation. There are a variety of transport systems available at the moment. For instance, we can travel on the railway, on the road, in the air, and the last possible choice is underground. That sounds good. We can travel anywhere and anytime we want. However, if we wanted to be somewhere at a specific time and something happened on our journey, what would we do? Well, the solution is in science and the future. As I have read in the last six months, most companies have been trying to provide a solution to get somewhere faster than now. Researchers brought us fast trains and fast cars. What is more, there is also a car that allows its passengers to get to the airport faster than by taxi. That is a car that uses a similar system as planes do, but for short distances. Maybe it is the future for the transport systems in big towns. It does not produce any emissions like carbon dioxide or sound. As far as I am concerned, I guess that the future of transportation, let's say travelling by air, is a number-one issue. Finally, it seems reasonable to act for supporting science. There is no choice for the future if we do not want to destroy our environment completely.

In which way will travel change? Firstly, with regard to energy. In fact, electric cars are at their apogee, so they can evolve with future energy that is more ecological, less and more available. This is actually due to ecological factors and because of the breach of resources. Secondly, because of the design of the cars, there is more technological aspect to cars and it might represent the cars of the future. These cars are of a new design, never seen before, like a round car, smaller etc... But the aspect of a car influences notably on its form, these are the aerodynamics that ameliore cars and let them be more beautiful and faster. To conclude, the design is associated with the speed factor of cars, and the energy is evolving so the future car is probably with an inconnue energy, and with a really awesome design that would surprise everyone. Goodbye. See you again!

To improve my English, I have to make a lot of sacrifices. I practise English two hours a day, but because of that I can't do what I want. For example, I don't watch series, don't read books that are for entertainment, but only English books or VOSTFR series and I have less time with my family. Moreover, this changes my routine, for example, when my dad is watching TV, it is embarrassing for me.

Firstly, being healthy is the fact of having good health with no huge medical problem, and being wealthy is the fact of being rich. Then, some people are really poor and they are ready to do everything possible to be better and have more money, but sometimes their limits are exceeded. It depends on the people concerned. Some people have a huge ego, so when they have a little bit of power in this world they can't limit themselves and they accumulate power, but at a certain point, this kind of people lose everything like Napoleon Bonaparte, for example. It should be that proposition: we have to limit the two parts and conciliate health and money with the objective of having a better life. You'll be richer because you'll live longer. To finish with, health and wealth are linked because with no money it's impossible to buy health in our actually world.

Learning to speak a foreign language was important in the past because there wasn't any translator available online, but employees who translated reunion. There are many ways to translate, like with dictionaries, but it took time and it did not help to form sentences only for the vocabulary, so there was coarse. The advantages in the past was only the employment and the inconveniences were multiple. We can say it was really important in the past to learn a language in order to not pay an employee and so limit expenses. At present, this is different because new technology has made communication easier. In fact, there are audio translators that translate a conversation immediately, or videoconference, translate on live. But it is interesting to learn some language if you want to travel around the world. To conclude, learning to speak a foreign language is important to have more opportunities and relationships. Even when there are possibilities to translate everything, it is important to be knowing about it.

Today, books aren't at their apogee. In fact, computers offer a lot of services such as digital books and magazines. Book readers are divided in two parts, the first concerns readers loyal to real books, the second are readers open to digital books. But in schools and university it is different because we're talking about education. To introduce computers and tablets in schools requires thinking about several factors like how the? How the numerical can be used and how many times per day. I think computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities, because they'll be less heavy in students' bags, and there will be fewer problems like lost lessons. Moreover, resources will be more available, which is really useful when students are absent, for example. But books are a part of history, it's a universe which is traditional.

My favourite season of the year is summer. Of course, this isn't original because a lot of people think the same , but for a lot of reasons I think the best moments I have lived were in summer. In the first place, I want to specify that I like every season, winter with its calm environment, autumn with its sadness, and spring with its softness. In the second place, summer is my favorite season because my favorite activities are carried out more in summer. For example, I really like to dance reggaeton in shorts, but in another season it's too cold to wear them. Then, in summer the sun comes out earlier and sets later, so I can imagine my day is longer and I have more time, so I can do more things. Thus, summer is my favorite season, and principally because I am sensible and in summer there are friends, lovers, and activities really improving my mood.

For many decades the educational system has brought many changes. As each of us remembers in the 19's we used to learn mainly from printed materials such as books. Our notes during the classes were being made with a pencil. Those simple methods of education in schools have survived until now. It seems reasonable to say that there is no doubt that these fundamental things will be used by schools for the next decades. In the last few years, the development of new learning methods in the field of technology is being implemented in schools and it is playing a key role in education for the future generation. More and more students use their mobile phones, computers, and similar tools to share information with others. An internet connection which is being widely spread provides students immediate access to the information they need. Even if students are absent from school, they can simply communicate with their teacher so as not to miss the class hours. The advantages stated above are playing an important role in implementing new technology at schools. On the other hand, schools face many difficulties. There is a lack of money to make their future in education come true. Lack of money slows down the whole process except in the educational institutions that belong to the government. If we want to move forward, we need to completely change the system of financing in the private sector. The implementation of new technology will bring benefits for both the schools and the students. Now, we are balancing at the edge of a new perspective in education. In the future, schools will be able to offer virtual education. Additionally, students who suffer from different disabilities such as those who cannot hear or see anything would be able to participate as well. Moreover, thanks to science, students who suffer from disabilities would have the same chance to share the same class with students without these disabilities.

In the last few months, I have tried out a new program to learn English in a fast and easy way. It was created by a magazine for young English learners. I like to work and learn with the new program because by using it you improve your English skills and contrary to other English learning programs it never gets boring. At first, I had my problems understanding the different tools but afterward, I was totally into it. Furthermore, I liked the design of this writing tool. The wrong words were in another color than the correct ones. Thereby, it is easy to write out the wrong words and you can learn them. Additionally, I love the fact that the program is for free and everyone can use it. To give you a more vivid idea of the tool I will describe it for you. On the main window, you have the opportunity to choose the task which you want to practise, or you can choose the button for a random task. After you have chosen one by clicking on it, the program opens a separate window in which you can write your text at the top of the page. The tool tells you what you should write and how many words you should use. I seriously recommend the tool to everybody who is learning English. It is a simple option to improve your skills and develop your language skills. Because of this tool, I managed my A-Levels. This should be reason enough to try it out.

My reasons for learning English Have you ever thought what your real reasons for learning English are? Everybody who tries to learn a foreign language knows that it is not an easy thing to do, but we continuously try to improve it and progress because of our private reasons, which keep us motivated. I have been learning English for 15 years and during this time my reasons have kept changing. Since when I was pressured to learn English in primary school I have completely changed my attitude. At this point, I consider English as the most popular language in the world, so you should learn this language because it can help you in many situations in your life. Another important reason for me is that I live in an English-speaking country, so I have to use it every day at work and everywhere else. I would compare learning English to a marathon, which is a long-distance competition. Therefore, you should keep in mind your own reasons because they will remind you why you are doing it.

My favourite film is Divergente. This is an action film that talks about people who are used to choosing a category of life, for example altruistic, brave, etc. But the main character is "divergente." It means she's all the categories, and has to hide it. I think you would like the film because it's really intense and it shows how differences can be risky.

When I was 16 years old, I went to Italy, to Alba Adriatica, and I was really excited. First of all, I was in a hotel with my family, including my sister and her boyfriend, my mother, and my father. The hotel was not luxurious, but it was in front of the sea so it was very easy to walk to the beach each morning and afternoon! The beach was private, it belonged to the hotel. There were deckchairs and umbrellas. The sand was extremely hot, so we had to run to the water and it was very funny. The routine was this one: we woke up, we ate breakfast, and went to the beach. At 12 o'clock, we returned to the hotel, took a shower and went to the restaurant to eat. Then we slept a little and we went back to the beach where we were sleeping, reading, listening to podcasts, for example, or just thinking and swimming. Afterwards, in the evening we went back to the hotel and did the same as at 12 o'clock. At night, we danced, drank cocktails, played cards, and made friends!

The world has changed, life has changed, and our bodies have changed too. People spend their time on the internet, playing video games or doing something that doesn't help them to improve their health. It is very important to have a healthy body to prevent diseases and have more energy. Running in the morning, drinking enough water, eating vegetables, and avoiding consuming junk food are the steps to follow to change your lifestyle. In Mexico people suffer from heart diseases, high cholesterol, and overweight. This is because there isn't good information about the importance of doing exercise or eating a balanced diet. Today, in schools the young suffer from overweight. For that reason, it is important that adults set the example at home to help their children to have a healthy life. I think that the young just need inspiration and motivation for an interest in the sports world or just wanting to have their mind and body in good shape.

My reasons for learning English are these ones. In the first place, English is a passion. In fact, a lot of people like English because at first, it was created to be the simplest language in the world. In contrast with the French language, which was the loy language for its complexity. Then, the English language is really liked to be pronounced because it's sweet and melodic! In the second place, English is an advantage in the professional and social aspects of life! As a matter of fact, a lot of countries speak English, like Australia, the United States of America, England... And to study in these countries, you have to pass an English exam, like TOEFL or IELTS. Moreover, when two people coming from two different countries are meeting, they usually speak English to understand each other. As a conclusion, you can travel around the world after learning English.

To whom it may concern. Forbidding the use of mobile phones is a topic worth discussing. Especially in public places. The idea of a complete ban might be the solution for all of our daily problems. People in trains would not look at their phone anymore. There would be more conversation going on. Perhaps, everybody would be more friendly as well. Nevertheless, in my eyes, this idea is an illusion. First things first. Don't people have the rights to do whatever they want to? As long as they are following the laws. Additionally, it is a rapid step. Nearly everybody uses their mobile in public transport. In shops and restaurants, it might be a good idea. However, if people want to communicate, they do it. The banning of mobile phones would not change that. As far as I can tell, most people do not use their mobile while eating. The old-school conversation strategies are not dead. By banning mobile phones, people might feel threatened with losing all their rights. And, aren´t their rights the most important object nowadays? This rule would ruin the image of the council and its policy. It would start an endless shitstorm until the law is gone. Furthermore, many people would not follow this rule. They just do not care about it. The personal freedom is more important than following a random rule which was not considered enough. It is not my call if phones get banned or not but it definitely would not be a smart move. Yours sincerely, Clemens

What is the truth ? I think there is a personal truth for each of us, especially in this case. We are not talking about general truths like theorems or formulas but we are talking about the truth which is different according to a viewpoint. Then we are asking if it is ever acceptable to tell a lie. But finally, what is a lie ? I think there are too many kinds of lies but it depends on what people in front of you define as a lie. For example, when you hide your bad grade, some parents will be really angry and disappointed because for them this is treason. Maybe they can think you are not confident with them. But for other parents you are just a child who is stressed because of bad grades and they won't notice it. In the first place, it is important to always tell the truth because, like everything else in life, the secret of success is discipline ! And if you are used to telling the truth, then, it will be natural for you to do this. And don't forget this is an important value and principle. But, in the second place, if you want to always tell the truth, that means that you accept the fact to be in danger because some people will ask you the right questions in order to trap you and it can be a serious obstacle in your life. To finish, don't forget that information is the most important resource, so use it well !

In the first place, I think it is important to define some words which are in this question. Firstly, we have to say what sport we are talking about here. When you are in a collective club sport like football or basketball, in most cases, even if you have only three training sessions per week, you have to go to the match on the weekend. If you do skiing, you have to go to the mountains and if you dance, you have to be present in the evening events. Secondly, what do you mean by forced? Is this an obligation? What are the official consequences? It needs to be more specific. In the second place I'll say why I agree and why I don't agree. Firstly, I agree because it is a really good thing to have interest in school children's health ! Especially because it trains them to be disciplined, in fact, if they have to go to do sports three times per week, they are used to being present. Then, they have more responsibility, they know they have to do sport, and they know this is for their health. There is another point we can notice, in effect, if they have to do sport, they become athletic and then they are prepared physically. Secondly, I don't agree because children have to realise their mistakes, so if we force them they lose autonomy, and this is the most important quality as an adult ! For me, sport has to be a choice, you can choose to do sport or be involved in your studies. instead of sport you can have another activity, like a reading club or something else. I think it is important to frame chlidren children but they have to develop their autonomy.

People lie all the time. Nevertheless, have you ever asked yourself if it is allowed to lie? Of course, you have. I have asked myself the same question. In the following essay, I am going to state my opinion. If you lied once, no one will ever trust you again. With this kind of action, you broke the trust of another person. And trust is earned. This is the greatest reason why you should never tell lies. It might not happen with the first lie, but always if you overwrought something, there are devastating consequences. In my eyes, it is different. You should not always tell everybody the truth. Anyway, you should not lie. To combine both there is one possibility. If you are not talking about the topic, you are not lying. Otherwise, if someone asks you a question which you do not want to answer, you could just change the topic. However, if the person forces you to answer, you should tell him or her a lie. This is the only way which allows you to lie. You should not lie. Otherwise, you will break the trust. However, if someone forces you to answer and there is no other way out, you have the right to lie. You do not have to tell everybody everything. Where would this end?

Television entertains. Sometimes it is just for passing the time, but sometimes it also educates! Most television programmes are made in order to entertain viewers, and they can be composed of provocations, controversies, ... But there are a few programmes that can be really useful and brainy! For example, there are programmes where you have to search inside your general culture to find answers to questions. This permits you in the first place to train your memory, and in the second place to learn culture. You can even find mathematical programmes on television. And on television there are a lot of channels, you can find documentaries about animals, the economy, history, and the news of the day .

Many of us are complaining about health problems all the time. We do not have enough time to take care of ourselves. We have accepted different living standards for many reasons. On the one hand, some of us have changed their priorities. Another key thing to remember is that we assumed that taking care of our health was a second priority after earning money. On the other hand, for those who started their active life in their childhood, their habits survived until their adulthood. They fully understood that the most beneficial thing for life was to keep their exercise routine at least two times per week in a roundabout kind of way. Money took second place in their personal life. As far as I am concerned, I would say that my personal experience is to stay in shape or to be healthy instead of having a lot of money. If I had the power to change something in today's rushed existence, I would set out three days off of work, or shorten the working hours in order for people to have more time for their families.

A report about my experience with Write and Improve Introduction The aim of this report is to present my experience with "Write and Improve" to my English teacher. Procedure The information below was collected from my experience of using "Write and Improve" during the last three weeks. Findings I believe that the "Write and Improve" website is a very powerful tool for improving your writing skills. Nevertheless, the biggest disadvantage is that it will not give you a clear message of what is wrong in your sentence. It works great for both spelling and grammar. However, when you make a mistake in the structure of your sentence, it just underlines the sentence without further information. Conclusion In conclusion, I think that everybody can benefit from this website. It is a great tool which gives you immediate feedback with the level of your writing. I can recommend this website to my classmates without any doubt as an excellent way of improving their English.

Learning is one of the fundamental processes that helps you to keep your mind in a better condition. For example, you make connections among your brain cells and make your memory get stronger. However, people are trying to increase their ability to memorize information through a variety of different ways. On one hand, competition is a basic way to persuade schoolchildren to care about their mental health and develop their ability to pick up information from different sources. Secondly, middle-aged people prefer to increase their memory through reading and communication with others instead of using school methods of education. An appropriate way of education is to work in groups and communication which seems to be the most important. As far as I am concerned, learning English as a second language offers both verbal communication and studying. The importance is when you are trying to find a well-paid job, or want to travel. Secondly, learning languages brings you to a new level of positive thinking and expanding your memory, which is needed when you get older.

It seems like I won't be able to go to the outside of the earth, but my son will be able to go to the moon. It is so expensive that most of us probably can't travel to the moon today. To be astronauts, we have to pass severe examinations. But Space X led by Elon Musk is likely to succeed in launching space ships which could return to the earth. In Japan a private company is trying too. I expect the day will come in 30 years when we can enjoy space travel. 'Fly me to the moon' will be real soon.

I have been thinking for a long time about what would be interesting about me. Finally, an idea came to my mind. I am going to tell you about my favourite film.

It tells the story of brave young men from Japan who were being put into a fight in a nonsense war. They were in a very difficult situation and there was no chance to escape from it. They spent all their time in a cave and wrote letters to their families, relatives, and beloved ones. However, the letters were never sent. Those letters were being hidden in sacks in the cave where they sheltered from the enemy during the war. It took more than four decades before the sacks were found. It is a story based on reality. I found the movie amazing and it made a real impression on me. I would like to recommend that you see it.

The school of the future! The world and technology have developed at such a quick pace. The current education system is quite different from what our grandparents remember. In what ways do you think schools will be different in the future? I believe that learning in class where there are another 30 people is not effective. Thus, to increase the quality of learning the amount of students in a class might be decreased to about 10 people. The other way to improve it is to create appropriate books or online talks, so students could learn from home. In the future, textbooks will be replaced by personal computers, so you will not have to carry a very heavy backpack. Scientists might also find a better system of how to comprehend knowledge more quickly. So, it will reduce the years which we spend in school. That is a difficult question to answer, because the future is unpredictable. However, I am sure that education will be different and more efficient than it is now.

There is a heated debate about whether schools and universities should replace printed materials with new technological inventions. Lots of surveys have been conducted among schools, showing the differences in using printed materials and technology. The results of these surveys were surprising. However, I am in two minds about it. On one hand, the first group included in the surveys were students. They prefer to use technology rather than books. by their flexibility. For example, you can be online with your teacher when you are absent from school. Not to mention, looking for information on the internet, or sharing information among other students. Moreover, a lot of printed materials do not need to be updated because they would be provided via the internet. This solution does not seem to be such a big financial burden as buying new printed materials. On the other hand, teachers claim that most of the books need not be replaced by technology. These materials need to be updated. The second reason for this is the price of implementing the new technology in schools which brings together other problems and takes a long time to be fully effective. As far as I am concerned, we live in a new century in which technology is playing the most important role in many fields of education. That is to say, we cannot avoid using new technology in our daily life. Technology eases our life in most aspects you can think about. However, the basic procedures of education will remain for many years – in a roundabout kind of way.

The second area is grammar, which is quite a complex topic, so I will have to spend a lot of time to improve it to a satisfactory level. Conclusion: It seems that, overall, I have some strong areas like listening and reading, and I have to put more effort into improving writing. I am going to practise a lot more than before and hopefully I will benefit from it in the future.

Every student is different. So each student needs different education for it to be proper for him. It may be called "tailor-made education." But it is very expensive to provide "tailor-made education" to students in the present system. Presently, thirty or more students are gathered in one classroom. And they are taught at the average level of education. The advanced students are bored. At the same time, there are students who can't catch up with the lessons. There are few students who are satisfied in the classroom. It seems that IT and AI will solve this problem. The AI could evaluate academic ability. The computer might guide students to improve their ability. Because the level and speed of a lesson is modified for each student, they will seem to be satisfied. If there wasn't group education, students' parents would worry that their children lose opportunities to learn about relationships. Of course, I don't like a physical education class with one student who is taught by computer. No matter what anyone says, group education will remain. But the tailor-made education will be widespread in the future too.

She was in San Luis because there was a racquetball tournament and she's a racquetball player. She stayed in the Real Inn Hotel and she practiced in the Loma Club. I took the bus on Saturday night from Veracruz to San Luis. The journey was amazing, I love listening to music while looking at the landscapes. I don't know, why but I feel that they relax me. When I arrived at the Loma Club I could see that my girlfriend was as happy as me, and that moment I got out of the taxi and we hugged. Those days were very comfortable for me 'cause she practiced racquetball in the mornings and I was in bed watching movies or sleeping and every afternoon we used to run or play tennis in the club.

Television gives us a variety of programs, for example, news, drama, music, talk show, educational, religious, and shopping programmes. I don't watch TV much these days. All programs are just one-way. Whatever I want, it forces information on me from the start to the end. These programs frustrate me rather than entertain me. I don't like to watch TV anymore. Educational programs have been educating us in Japan. When I was a child, we watched an educational program on the education channel. The lessons were like "be nice to the elderly," or "don't behave egoistically in public." From this point of view, programs can educate. It is really a one-way education. The one-way teaching gives us a lot of information and knowledge, but doesn't give us an opportunity to learn deeply. I am afraid that we might be brainwashed by this one-way education.

The importance of speaking a foreign language has increased in its value. In comparison to the 20th century in which people did not have any possibility to show their language skills, it has completely turned around now. It is being claimed that the ability to speak a foreign language is dominant among middle-aged people. A popular argument for this is that young people need it in preparation for their future life. A persuasive argument is to work abroad. Secondly, there is a group of people who did not find a persuasive argument to learn a foreign language. Those are elderly people and they would like to spend the rest of their life quietly. My personal view is that they deserve a quiet life – in a roundabout kind of way. One way or another, today's generation of young people must learn a foreign language because we were not given such an advantage of travelling abroad or applying for a job in other countries.

I'm really motivated for this new year at school, I hope I can comply with all my goals. First, I want to improve my English speaking. I haven't problems understanding the language, but it is very complicated for me to be able to speak fluently. Second, I would like to organize a music workshop. I can play different musical instruments and it will be a great idea that the students at school will be able to learn a musical instrument. Also, it is very important for the young to learn the importance of having a hobby and taking music classes is the best hobby. I really have high expectations about the teachers and their ways of teaching because in my last school the teachers where very conformist with the level of the students and the teachers didn't motivate them to improve their goals and expand their knowledge. That was very disappointing, but now I'm sure that this year will be different.

I have recently discovered Write and Improve, a new writing tool for learners of English. I would like to write more about its features. Write and Improve is a website which allows you to write plenty of emails on various topics. There are 3 levels of difficulty from beginner to advanced so I am sure you will find exercises suitable for your skills. I have been using this website for 2 months now and I can honestly say that it helped me a lot. Over the past two months I have become more eloquent, I gained confidence in writing and I write emails much faster. What I really like about Write and Improve is its simplicity. Everything is clear and simple, you know exactly where the things are and it isn't exaggerated. What I don't like is that the page doesn't give me hints about how the sentence could be written in a different way. Luckily I don't make many mistakes. However, two days ago I was struggling with a problem. I realized that I spend too much time on your webpage. I suppose I got addicted to it. Of course I'm joking. To sum up, I would like to recommend this page to you because it is truly a masterpiece. I really improved my English and it will be improving even more.

Dear Sir or Madam, After seeing the information about plans to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, I am writing to give my opinion about this issue. You probably have arguments to support your decision, however you should consider my opinion as there are many people like me who think exactly the same. First of all, I would like to know what is wrong with using mobile phones in public places like buses, shops or restaurants, because I cannot find a reason which would be strong enough to ban them in all those places. Furthermore, it can cause many problems for people who will need phones in a bus to call an ambulance or the police in emergency. I strongly believe that most people do not like to waste time while travelling in public transport and they use this time to read something interesting on the internet or to communicate with family and friends. Therefore, once you ban using mobile phones you will make this time unproductive for them. Additionally, we use our phones to make a shopping list or take a photo of a delicious meal which we ordered in restaurant to write a review on the internet. In conclusion, my friends, my family and I think that this idea will not bring any good benefits to our life. Furthermore, it may make our life more difficult. I hope to hear that you give up this idea. Yours faithfully, Karol

My favourite film is the Hunger Games. In this film there are three things that I really like. Firstly, I like the idea of the districts because we can see that as a caricature of real life. In fact there are neighborhoods divided by social class. Secondly, I really like the role of Katniss Everdeen played by Jennifer Lawrence. In fact, she represents strength, beauty, love, and loyalty, and is a revolutionary. Thirdly, my favorite scene was when Katniss broke the technological wall with her arrow because it shows that women can be intelligent and powerful. I think you should watch this film because it is a classic and there are so many values in it !

In your last letter, you asked me to provide you with some information about the concert I visited with my wife last week. As far as I am concerned, my first recommendation is to buy the tickets in advance if you are intending to go there. We saw many successful singers and their performance was breathtaking. If I have the chance to provide an assessment of their total performance, I will give them the highest possible ranking. By and large, the venue was surprising and the audience got me in a good mood. Yet there was one thing that made us happier than ever and it was our unexpected baby. Imagine, we are at the concert and all of a sudden my wife was calling for help. The ambulance arrived in a minute and our daughter was born in the middle of the concert. Finally, as a congratulation, we were awarded with an applause from the whole public. What is more, due to the event, they sang a song for our newborn girl. It was almost impossible to describe our happiness at that moment - in a roundabout kind of way.

MY FAVOURITE SEASON OF THE YEAR Each of us has our favourite season of the year, but most of us have one favourite: summer. WHY? I think because this is the time off from school and it is beautiful weather too. Honestly, I don't have a favourite season of the year as I really like all of them. However, if someone told me to choose one, I would probably choose summer. Why? Of course, there are a lot of things that I like in summer. First of all is the fact that we have time off from school and we don't have to study. We can spend our holidays with friends and family and have a great time with them. Am I right? My favourite thing in summer is also the sunny weather and that I can go to the lake or sea and swim or sunbathe. And I love riding a bike with my friends, too. That's my article about my favourite season , I hope you'll like it and tell me about your favourite season. You can write your thoughts here if you want to.

Dear Sir or Madam, I recently heard about your latest idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is a good idea to be honest. In today's world we experience the problem with excessive addiction to our mobile devices. We use them every day and for at least a few hours. When getting into a bus, tram or restaurant we can notice a lot of people staring at the screens of their devices. It is a common problem. Doing that we not only lose our concentration but we even lose the ability to talk with other people. It can make us socially anxious. Banning the use of mobile phones in public can prevent us from getting all sorts of mental illnesses. What is more, we would finally end the recent fashion with posting pictures of food on Instagram. I hate it when people do that. I still can't understand what might be the purpose of doing things like that. I am very pleased that this horrible fashion is eventually going to end. And actually, I don't know what to write now. I know I can write what I want but in this particular email I can't find more arguments. So basically I will write whatever comes to my mind.

It is widely believed that particular students are doing fewer sports activities. However, that's simply not the case. It has been supposed that children should do exercises three times per week or even more. There are those who argue that students are lazy and to fight these bad habits, sports are the perfect solution. I totally agree with this statement. Nevertheless, I'm a keen and probably already a professional climber, and in my best times, I trained four times per week. There can be no doubt that not every child can adopt these habits. When I started to train climbers, I spent lots of time thinking. How is it feasible that some of them just refuse to listen to the advice and instructions of other coaches? If they were in my group, they would be kicked out, faster than you can wink, particularly those who literally never do what you tell them. Not everybody is made for sports. I am a big supporter of any kind of sport. However, students should not be forced to do exercises. Sports are a lifestyle and a passion and not a thing that people do to fight their laziness. Notwithstanding that, I do not support this proposal. I would like to give you another solution. As I mentioned, sports are a passion and they might even be somebody's destiny. As far as I can tell, everyone who does not do any sports just did not find the right one. I propose to set up a program where students have the opportunity to try out different kinds of sports. Taking all these aspects into consideration, I do not agree with the assertion. Sports are awesome! Furthermore, they have an incredible effect on your learning, they are everything but bad. Nonetheless, to force students to do sports is the wrong way, it would have detrimental effects on students and their opinion of sports. Let them find the sport they love and they will do it all day long.

In my opinion, the topic is very complicated. On the one hand, it is important to always tell the truth but sometimes there are situations when it's better to tell a lie. Each issue is different and there is no universal solution to solve every case in a good way for both sides. Telling the truth has both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage is that you are being honest with yourself and what is more important, with the person who you talk to. On the other hand, the truth can sometimes be painful for the other person and many things can change in the relationship between you and him or her. But you can tell yourself that you said what had to be said and you won't be feeling guilty afterwards. On the other hand, sometimes it's better to tell a lie. It is easier and can be less painful for the recipient but not for us. The worst part of telling a lie is that in most cases remorse can be unbearable and eventually we decide to tell the truth. The point is it all depends on the situation. This topic is a bit hard to expand on. At least for me. Sometimes I find it hard to write more about the topic. I have never had a gift for creating stories.

The popularity of video games among children has increased in recent years. To be more precise, children tend to play video games instead of taking part in activities such as sport, which is a key factor in their development. In recent discussions, we can hear arguments that support the idea of playing video games. On the other hand, there are negative arguments as well. In my view, playing video games has a positive impact on children's mind. To give an illustration, it supports their ability to react quickly to a situation by making an immediate decision. Secondly, they also develop their imagination in many situations and it helps them to solve problems such as school tasks. The negative impact of playing video games is described by parents as an inability to solve fundamental tasks relating to our daily life. That is to say, the tasks for which their difficulty is adequate for the age of the children. All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume the fact that our children are growing up in the 21st century and it is hard to steer clear of the upcoming technology. To put it in another way, our children will be dependent on new technology – in a roundabout kind of way.

I live in the Czech Republic where you can find at least four zoos. Moreover, each of the zoos offers its visitors a certain kind of entertainment as well. People in our country usually come to the zoos to see the animals. What is more, the majority want to escape from their busy lives for the weekend. However, a certain percentage of people come to the zoo to educate their children. Needless to say, we do not see the animals in the zoos as prisoners, we see them as a thing that has roots in our mind as an entertainment. On the other hand, I have never thought about it in the way that those animals belong in nature as well as human. Try to imagine you will take the place of animals in the zoo tomorrow. It seems like a terrible fantasy, doesn't it? What I am trying to say is that we should not turn a blind eye to animals and do our best to give them a better future.

Everyone has a dream to have a long and quiet life. People expect that the longer their lives become, the more peaceful their lives will be. However, I think that the opposite is true. I would like to describe my reasoning below. First of all, people need to prepare a lot of things if they live long, which usually requires tremendous burdens in advance. For example, many people are concerned about their future financial plans, especially after retirement, as the average life span has been extended more and more these days. Second, there are quite a number of unexpected problems happening all over the world, such as natural disasters, and novel virus turmoil. This proves that the longer people live, the more they will encounter difficulties they cannot control on their own. As a result, it will be rare to find tranquil moments in their daily lives in such disastrous conditions. The last reason is that people never appreciate their precious lives, unless they utterly notice that the clock is ticking. To make the most of every moment, it is so much easier for people to have a short intense life, rather than a long and calm one, which might unintentionally mislead people they have tons of time left. For these reasons, I support the idea that a short but intense life is the better option in most cases.

People have different opinions about the importance of telling the truth. Some insist that it is still acceptable to tell a lie, if necessary. However, I would like to counter this opinion. I will describe my reasoning as follows: First, although people believe that they are very good at hiding their actual feelings by telling a lie, what they think will be unconsciously delivered to the person they are talking with somehow. For instance, children sometimes express their feelings how much they hate their parents. However, deep down, they know their honest feelings are totally the opposite. This example is very straightforward, but basic theory can be applied to any situation anyhow. Second, once people are used to telling lies to others without feeling guilty, it will easily become their second nature. This will mislead people into having doubts if others’ opinions are trustworthy or not. Any relationship based on a firm trust is essential for any occasion, no matter who you are with at work, at school, or at home. The last reason is that people often excuse their lies by saying that they protect other people from being hurt. This is simply because people do not try to be diplomatic enough to deliver their opinions. I am a strong believer that being a good communicator is having a caring behavior to others. In summary, for these reasons, I maintain that although we need to pay a lot of attention to how to maintain good trust and relationships with others, we should be honest as much as possible.

The spring season is the most important part of starting your new year because it gives you the energy you need after a long wintertime. It fills you up with the energy you will need for the upcoming rest of the year. To obtain energy from the sun, I usually spend my free time in the garden, which is good advice for many people who want to do something useful and simultaneously deviate from tidy daily routines u2013 in a roundabout kind of way. Not to mention your immune system, which needs to fill up the battery as well to work properly. Secondly, spring brings you an opportunity to set off for somewhere to look around or visit a castle. My best choice is to assume this season as a start to achieve your new goals, such as reducing your weight or becoming better in an activity you like doing. If you have the possibility like me and you live near a national park, my recommendation is to try cycling or walking. As far as I am concerned, movement in the fresh air is the best start to a new season.

As far as I am concerned, my activities include cycling, running and walking. If you want to stay in good shape and condition, I would recommend changing your activity more often.

Dear town council, I heard that there are intensive discussions among the town council members about banning mobile phone usage on public transportation, in shops and restaurants. I assume the advantages and disadvantages of this plan have been thoroughly evaluated by experts. In conjunction with this, I would like to express my strong disagreement with this plan as a tax payer, too. To begin with, it is too drastic for people to adjust their current ways of working and manage their daily activities if the ban comes into force. Communications on mobile phones have been inevitable for social infrastructure for the past three decades. Without them, I think that productivity at work will be decreased, even though the ban is effective within limited areas. Another reason is that people nowadays need to reach someone as well as to be reachable whenever they need from anywhere due to security reasons. For instance, parents, who are still heading back home on a commuter train, will be relieved when they receive a call from their children at home. Another example is that children, whose aged parents live remotely, will be seriously worried about the parents’ health condition when their parents do not answer the cell phone, who might be simply eating out at that time. Having said that, I maintain the idea that appropriate phone usage should be kept for good manners in public places. My suggestion is to introduce dedicated times and dates for specified places or zones where using mobile phones triggers severe punishment. I firmly believe that the idea of banning mobile phones in such areas is still not ready for the above reasons. It would be greatly appreciated if the council members would reconsider the plan. Best regards, AAAA BBBB

This is it! It is here! Look through the window. Spring is coming - my favourite season of the year. I want to say, I like all seasons of the year, but I love it when the first flowers are coming out and the grass is getting a little bit greener than it was two or three days ago. The sun is shining a little bit brighter and the wind is whispering that the snow has gone and there is the smell of easiness. With most of the people you meet, you will see a smile on their faces and maybe you will notice the same easiness on some of them as you felt when the wind was whispering in your ears and stroking your skin. At this time, I will only take my camera, go out all day long and take a picture of all the new life I will encounter. This makes spring so special for me. It brings new life to the earth, every year and I want the easiness I feel through the spring throughout the entire year.

There are many arguments why people think that it is beneficial for students to have the same teacher for several years. From the other point of view, people believe that having a different teacher at least each year is more productive and beneficial for students. I am in two minds about that. Firstly, having the same teacher for several years gives a teacher more opportunity to know his students a lot better. If I take an example from my childhood, my teacher was deeply familiar with the problems I was having in my family life and how these problems contributed to my assessment at school. The communication between us has improved since that time. To be more precise, he knew how I was able to solve my tasks given by him. Last but not least, the fact that the teacher knew each student personally for many years, offered a variety of possibilities to deal with each other more completely. Regarding the second argument stated above, I would like to say that having a different teacher each year reduces the teacher’s chances to know his students better. In this case, solving problems with students usually puts the teacher in a difficult situation because his personality would be different from what he thought about him. For example, if we do not know where the problems come from, we will usually find it difficult to give any support – in a roundabout kind of way. If I look at both sides, having the same teacher for several years seems to be the most favourable situation. I completely agree with the statement that a teacher should have to know their students from both sides, which means personally and mentally. If there is no cooperation between a student and a teacher, we will not achieve any desired success or resolution we set before.

My favourite season of the year Everyone is unique and prefers different things, and this is why every human being is special. A report that I read online said that people tend to love the season that they are born in more. But I disagree with this statement because some people prefer the cold instead of warmth. Even though I was born in September , in autumn , I love summer more. My mom told me that when she went to hospital, it was so hot that you couldn't stay outside for 10 minutes without feeling dizzy, but when she got home with me it was extremely cold, the season changed within a week. So I think this is the best explanation why I love summer so much. If you couldn't tell until now, my favourite season is summer. You might think I enjoy summer this much because it is hot and sunny , but this isn't the truth. Actually it is , but freedom is the main reason why. Just being free and hanging out with friends or going to the pool is the real reason why I think summer is the best. Being hot and sunny is just a plus and everyone who reads this can agree with me that summer is the best season to make memories. What do you think? Which is the best season and why? It's a sure thing summer is mine. Kisses, Roxana

Music is an integral part of our life, when we listen to music we feel emotion and develop our creativity. But as part of the school, is it a good thing ? In the first place I'll tell you why music as a subject is to be avoided, in the second place I'll tell you how to learn music if you want to add this obligatory subject in your school. Firstly, music is not made to be a subject, but something outside school. Usually, students listen to music on the trip to school and to their house, and after they finish their homework. So, imagine that students associate music with school, it will stop being something relaxing. For example, if a guy really hates school but loves music, and he realises that the subject of music isn't cool in school, he can imagine that it is the same in the professional world and stop his talent. Secondly, if you absolutely want to teach music in your school, you have to make this subject attractive, and associate this class with something more fun than traditional lessons. For the same example as the first part, if this student finds this subject interesting, he can search for the pursuit of studying music. To conclude, use music correctly and make your students happy to come to music lessons even if they are not talented in it. Creating different workshops for each level will permise to interest everyone to develop their capacity.

University is really hard, for me both of these solutions have advantages and inconveniences. Living with your family has many advantages; You are helped by them and you don't have to pay the rent or the food. They are an emotional support for you. But, there are a lot of inconveniences. For example, you don't have your intimacy, you can't leave and return to the house when you want and you can't invite friends. But the worst is that they can perturb your revision, you can be devloved. Remember: too much emotion equals less stability. Living alone has more advantages; You have all your intimacy, you can make choices that you want, for example you can eat when you want. You don't have to do the housework everyday because you have your own organization. And finally, you have all the calm for study because no one can disturb you. But there are inconveniences too. You can feel alone sometimes, and your food isn't as good as your parents, moreover you don't have a lot of money, then you don't eat so much. You have to solve your own problems. I prefer living alone because it develops autonomy and organization.

Volunteer work is a way for students to help an association for disabled people, or a community, for example, gays left in the street by their parents, or Black and Latino people who are victims of racism... Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In the first place I'll say why it's really good for them but in the second place I'll say why I think it is convenient. In the first place, making volunteering an obligation forces students to help other people and see what is going on for people who need help. They'll be more comprehending about difficulties present in the country and they can be really useful. In the second place, I think it shouldn't be necessary. In fact, it seems good but some students do that only for university and when they are in the association, they help nobody or are unpleasant. The best way to correct this error is this one: universities should add a recommendation letter in the folder of the student, then the association or the person concerned with the student's volunteering can explain the behavior of this one. With that, even if students don't like volunteering, they're obliged to do their work well.

Write and Improve is a good platform to practise your writing in your free time because a lot of times we spend a lot of time on other things and we neglect contact with the English language. This medium is very easy to use, you just need internet and to create an account. On the platform are any topics with different levels. I really like this platform because I can practise at any time with my computer or my cell phone from my home or work. In my experience, I have improved very fast. Every day I write one or two reports and that is very satisfactory to me. I think that it is a good idea that teachers recommend this platform to their students. This is a great working tool that should be used by all people that want to learn English. At the moment I have an intermediate level.

I think Write and Improve is a really good website. It makes me improve my English writing. On this website, there is a timer so I know what time I have to write in. There are a level and a test zone, so I can prepare for my exam. It gives information from the first writing until the last writing so I know my progress. People don't need to use their money because the website is free and people can donate their money to this website if they get satisfied. But, I am sometimes a little bit scared because this website asks for my biodata or my family life, even though that is something that is normal to ask. I feel that this website is asking something over and over. I don't know if it will be a negative thing or not. But, I think this is still worth a try. I don't feel this website has any weakness, so I will recommend my classmates to try Write and Improve.

It is often discussed if there is a right to die. Many old people rather want to die instead of staying in a bed because they are not fit anymore. As a result, they prefer a shorter, more intense life than a longer and calmer one. In the following text, I shall consider two arguments why everyone should choose a shorter one. One point is you only live once. If you just spend your time on hanging around and relaxing, you will not experience something. When you are shortly before your death, it is better to say "Wow, I had many experiences and although I haven't been living for a long time, I had a valuable life" than seeing nothing, isn't it? Probably the most important argument is that a calm life cannot go along with a happy life. You should have your time to do what you like - no matter if you want to do sports, travel or go to work. Additionally, to reach real happiness you need people you love like a family and friends. Having got to know these people, you must invest your free time for them, especially a family is very time-intensive. In conclusion, you need to invest your free time in doing things you like to get completely content. In view of the above arguments, no one should waste time and start to live. Of course, it is good to relax to get new energy for new discoveries. But in the end, it is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.

I am pleased with my writing. But, I still need to improve writing. So, the areas that I want to improve are reading, speaking, listening, and writing. I want to improve these areas until I can get a good score in IELTS or TOEFL or other tests like that. To achieve my goals, there are several ways that I have already thought of. For speaking, I think I will start with trying to think in the English language, not my language. For listening, I will start with listening to podcasts and watch YouTube videos where the speakers are native. I will listen to different podcasts and to YouTube, so I can listen to English speakers even with many types of voices. For reading, I will start with reading novels and comics and doing some exercises from some websites and books. For writing, I will do Write and Improve workbooks every day until I can do IELTS Academic workbooks without having to think about the verbs that I often forget and get a good grade.

For me, holiday is just me. I don't feel any special things about any of my holidays. Because of that, I will choose the holiday that I most remember. A holiday to Bali last year was really important to me. I choose this because I met some good friends. They are really fun and don't judge me for something that I do. I feel like I can be myself because of them. When I went to Bali, I went to restaurants, religious places, some beaches, art places, a night market, and other places that I cannot remember. The first thing that I loved about this place was the food. I saw some beaches, too. I even swam at the beach and played some games there. In Bali, I took a lot of photos with my friends. In the art place, I wanted to see a traditional dance, but I did not do that because the place was really crowded. We felt that we would not feel comfortable, so we left. The last day, I had free time with my friends, so we went to Kuta Beach to take some photos. Those are the things I remember most about Bali.

The first thing that is really important for our health is hygiene. If people cannot maintain cleanliness in their life, it will be useless. I will give my analysis. First, if you can't maintain hygiene with your food, you will get sick more easily. People often don't feel sick after their first or second meal, but, if their immune system goes down, people will get sick more easily because of unhealthy food, even though they eat some healthy foods. Second, if you do exercise with discipline, but after doing exercise you don't take a bath or the place for the exercise is not clean, it just makes you get sick. If the floor and the mattress aren't clean, you just get some bacteria and viruses in your body. Taking a bath actually helps you to expel them from your body, so don't be lazy about doing that. Third, you have to clean your house. Most people are lazy about doing that, but if you still have that character, bacteria and viruses will live in your house. Your immunity will be down, and you will get sick; maybe starting with influenza until you get some dangerous diseases.

Dear Sir, Dear Madam, As I read your suggestion to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, I was excited, so I want you to know that you will have my full support. I have been living in this town for 17 years noticing how it has changed. Especially young children are only sitting in front of their smartphone while they are riding on the bus. Even more, they are rarely talking to their friends anymore. I do not like this development. Of course, sometimes I also use my smartphone while I am sitting in the bus or train if there is no one I know. If there are any acquaintances, I will definitely talk to them. Even worse is in restaurants. My parents have already told me it is unacceptable and impolite sitting in a restaurant with a mobile phone. Usually there you are not alone, consequently there is someone you can talk with. Despite this, daily I see a growing number of families who are sitting in a restaurant using a smartphone. In conclusion, I would strictly recommend a ban of smartphones in public places. The next generations are used to having a smartphone as a replacement for conversations with acquaintances, which is unhealthy as well as unsocial. As a result, I think we should affect this development with that new law. Yours faithfully, Helen Deuchar

There are too many doctors working in large capitals, resolving some of them are redundant. However, on the antithetical side, too few doctors are operating in the countryside. This is a controversial issue, that desperately requires solving immediately. Otherwise, the circumstance that sick people do not have a doctor in their municipality is imminent. Every individual town needs a doctor and due to the reason that this is such an urgent matter, there are some solutions. Nevertheless, it is indisputably important to know why doctors in provincial areas are thin on the ground. Strictly speaking, none of the freshly graduated doctors are willing to move to small villages. They simply earn too little. There can be no doubt that a doctor can medicate more people in big cities than in small towns, conclusively it is more profitable for them to work in the city. One possibility is to ensure more doctors in rural areas might have a education time or a reduction in their tuition. Thereby, especially those who do not have the necessary capital might take the opportunity. It would be a great occasion for the townspeople as well as for the doctors. Alternatively, the town's inhabitants need to pay the doctors an annual payment. There can be no doubt that they require a doctor in the vicinity. Overall, the inhabitants of every town would be responsible for their doctor, it would be an egregious chance. Most people think that moving away from the cities is unattractive. Revamping the frequently traditional towns might accommodate that viewpoint. Another peripheral side effect is that the living quality in these towns would increase tremendously. Taking all these aspects into consideration, there can be no doubt that there are some solutions to the current situation, which needs to be solved.

There can be no doubt that open offices support creative thinking and ensure team-work. They even increase the working experience tremendously, so that the collaborators interact with each other. It might even be the case that critical thinking skills, as well as acumen, are enhanced if the programmers have an open design office. However, single-person offices are proven to be more effective, as a result of the fact that there is little to no disturbance. The workers can put their entire focus on the project and it would necessitate that they have to work because there is nobody to converse with. Nevertheless, people need changes and differences, so that a completely entrepreneurial office design might be an egregious expectorate. All over the world companies take advantage of similar office designs, especially multinational corporations promulgate their creative methods to design offices. Most of them are of the complexion that creative tasks are the significant ones, nowadays. Formerly, companies deemed green spaces and other free-time activities in their office complexes as needless. However, it is a fact that green spaces additionally support creative parts of the mind, so that workers are even more effective. Taking all these aspects into consideration, the best opportunity would be to have two different kinds of offices for every single person so that they can change their surroundings depending on what they are working on at the moment. There are different kinds of assignments and tasks, and every single one needs individual circumstances. It is out of the question that two office seats per person are too expensive, resulting in that a shift system without permanent positions might be the best chance. Office designs are an increasingly complex concern and many architects are doing their utmost to solve this situation to find the best available design which is supportive on the one hand and efficient on the other hand. Furthermore, it needs to remove every kind of inconvenience.

There is no understandable response to the question of how long-drawn your life is supposed to be. The entire predicament is unsolvable, due to the reason that nothing can control the length of your life. Some personalities discover their way through misfortune and others suffer from a disease. However, you can determine how you fill the years you become and if you are rather precarious or circumspect. Remaining until you are 100 years old, but missing quintessential opportunities, because you consider them as too hazardous, is a pathway most people would prefer. You always would have something to maintain and experience one complete century. In the case that your spouse begets children early, they might even find their way to heaven before you do, which is an encounter most people would not desire to have. Alternatively, the opportunity is given that you live less, but with more mindblowing situations. Not uncertainly living for the moment is intelligible, nevertheless, your activities always would include the trivial possibility that you might vanish. The vulnerability of dying because of everything you are doing, naturally because you want to make the most out of it, sounds rather unreasonable. Considering all these steps, the shorter life is the one I would choose. The threat of dying is something we experience each day and missing moments, frankly because you want to turn 100 one day, sounds implausible for me. Furthermore, the mindset that you do your utmost to survive as long as possible does not assume it is worth carrying around as a responsibility with me. Strictly speaking, it would dismantle me.

The question to rather stay home or pay rent whilst visiting a university, so that students are independent of their parents, necessitates being answered by every individual student. Fraternities are a unique opportunity to make friends and make studying fun. It is not only about studying itself, strictly speaking, but the whole experience is also marvelous. Nobody describes your actions and you can do whatever you want. This might transpire to be more difficult than expected. For example, all the taxes and bills that do not reach you in childhood need to be taken care of and consume your time. Additionally, you need to squander your time for looking for flats, because you probably need to move around several times. Alternatively, staying at home also has its extraordinary advantages. In accordance with your parents you could have a tranquil place to study and paying rent as well as food is none of your concern. It rather resembles plain sailing through university, than the hard path of moving out. Particularly, for families whose budget is petite it facilitates their children with an outstanding education for little money, due to the reason that they only have to pay for the tuition. Taking every aspect into consideration, both options are fine. I would prefer to study away from home. All these outrageous experiences in a university are something I am not willing to miss. However, in the case that my study - course is offered in my city, I would not move away, resolute I would end up at home until I am finished with university.

A few months ago I discovered a useful tool for writing in the English language called "Write and Improve“. However, it is not the only tool I use to improve my writing. As a second tool, I use "Grammarly“. Each tool scores its writers according to different ways of the settings they did before writing. If I can make a recommendation, I would say both of them have advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the tool Write and Improve is sectioned in four levels of progress from beginner to advanced. A result of your hard work is awarded. The function of each award is your support to start a new writing task to reach the next award. Besides, the tool offers services like checking your writing by a teacher or participation in a class where you can provide your advice to other students. Simultaneously, you can share the task you created for others. Secondly, the tool Grammarly does not offer creating writing tasks or to answer them. This tool is completely different from Write and Improve. It can only check your writing and it offers you a correction of your mistakes. To use this tool more effectively is to make a setting for your writing goals. All things considered, as a result of my recommendation, I would say the tool Write and Improve is much more useful for students of English at different levels. Conversely, Grammarly seems to be the most useful tool for those who use English in their work. For example, to write a business letter or write an essay on a topic you want.

It is very normal how the world and technology evolve. Video games are a very important influence on children's education. At present, there are different prototypes of video game, but the most famous are the video games with themes of violence, war, money, or power. Also, many teenagers prefer to spend a lot of time playing video games instead of studying or in the worst case these video games can provoke violent behavior in the lives of children. I think that it is the responsibility of parents to take care about their children's activities and prevent bad behaviour, likewise, to motivate teenagers to do sports activities and teach them to recognize when a video game can influence them negatively. In my humble opinion, I don't like to see any one boy of 10 years old or more wasting their intelligence and energy on something that will not help their future. The country and the world need young boys with different ideas to change the evolution.

Video games regroup a lot of categories, some of them are considered good, others are considered bad. In the first place, I'll explain the good parts of video games. In the second place, I'll explain the bad parts of video games. In the first place, video games can be a good way for children to get education, for example, you can find mathematics, language, or science games on a smartphone, on "Wii," ... In the second place, video games can have a bad influence on children, but it is the parents' role to control what their children play. For example, you can forbid war games and games with violence, sex, ... To conclude with my opinion about the subject of the influence of video games, I think that children who have a problem with violence, studying less, bad organization, etc. have to be educated. Video games or not, a child who is violent will keep the same attitude. Parents can let their children play with video games, but they have to educate them and limit their activities in order to create a cohesion between autonomy and rules.

Does it improve the student's awareness of the post-school time if they do volunteer work? By working, students have the opportunity to experience different types of tasks and might figure out what they want to work in after they have graduated. The ideal would be if they find a certain job they like, so that they can study the required subject and always have a delightful motivation, due to the reason that the students already know how inspiring the time after university will be. Volunteer work is proven to help students to enhance their social skills. For example, if the students do babysitting, they are not only doing it for the parents but also themselves. The requisite abilities you need in order to handle the infants appropriately are also necessary for most jobs. Furthermore, it embellishes your CV. In the beginning, you might overwork yourself and think that you are not designed for hard work. However, that is simply a way to ameliorate your way of thinking, because you sometimes have to take the rough with the smooth. And if you are smarter afterward, volunteer work is definitely a worthwhile occupation. Nevertheless, some students might have a different take on the topic and consider it wasted time. Students are convinced of the assertion that spending time with their friends is more important. Moreover, extra-curricular activities, which are mostly of a sporting kind are a way to improve your body as well. Taking all those aspects into consideration, volunteer work is a worthwhile occupation and it will do nothing bad to your mind, or your body. In my opinion, it should not replace sports activities but work as an addition to your high school time-table.

I always have been against animal abuse. I think that it is very important that animals can grow in a free space or in their own habitat. When I was a child, I loved going to zoos and enjoyed watching the behavior of animals while they were in their cage and at that moment I understood that they couldn't be happy there. Today, animal captivity is very common, in many places hunting is normal. It is like a hobby and for that reason at present there are many associations fighting for animals' rights. I would like to participate someday in these awareness campaigns. It's fundamental that we form part of a society that can change rules, ideas, and behavior to improve the world and conserve our nature. It's fundamental to teach children to take care of the environment, they are the new generation and have the responsibility to create innovative solutions in the future.

What will the school of the future look like? Will robots with sophisticated Artificial Intelligence replace the teachers? Will future education be based on virtual technology? In the next 20 or 30 years most likely schools will be changed because new technology will change everything in the future. The idea of robots and virtual classrooms could become very popular. Many people believe that it is only a matter of the time when intelligent machines will replace teachers. Robots will offer more than the teachers: a more personalised and individual experience for pupils and university students. In the future, the traditional chalkboards will certainly be replaced with interactive whiteboards and more virtual devices will be placed in the future schools. But there is still one question which we will ask, how will virtual education change the traditional values of classroom conversation and social interaction between the students or between the teachers and the students? But it is also true that technology now enables students to design posters, websites and blogs, and interact online. It is up to us which way future transformations of education will go and placed.

Dear Mayor, I'm writing to you because I would like to share my mind about your decision to ban the use of mobiles on public transport. In my opinion, I think it will be very bad decision for many reasons. Firstly, keeping connected with your mobile is, nowadays, something very important. The phone is very useful to guide us everywhere where we want to go. Furthermore, we have the possibility to be connected through internet and this allows us to keep ourselves informed about everything around us. Secondly, this is something very useful in case of a threat. For instance, if somebody has a problem on public transport or anywhere, they can call the police in order to stop the problem. Or, another reason is if there is a fire somewhere, calling the firemen is a good thing. Thirdly, keeping the use of mobiles in any circumstances allows the person to be always found anywhere and anytime. There were kidnappings a long time ago. I believe via mobiles we can keep track of it and indeed, save people's lives. In conclusion, I would like to remind you that using mobile data to keep people protected is a very good thing. Obviously, I don't agree with a bad use of mobile data. I mean that personal data use is not matched at a human right. I'm talking about freedom.

In the last twenty years, television and multimedia have changed, but we need to ask if television and multimedia are going the right way. Television is serving us a lot of entertainment which is easy to watch without any deep meaning or any deep sense. They will serve us uncomplicated programs not demanding any involvement of thought. In consequence, we do not learn new things or we do not ruminate about science or different countries, or many other things. We have thematic programmes which give us information about science or space, or about how animals live, and they are more educational. For example, Discovery or Animal Planet are more educational than others. In my opinion, there should be more educational programmes which will be directed at pupils and students. Those programs should be targeted at engaging the young generation with life on earth, science, and space. These thematic channels should cooperate with schools to develop a wide range of interesting facts which could help in the classrooms.

Studying abroad is the fact of studying in another country for a time during high school or university. In the first place, we will look at the advantages of this practice and secondly, we will see the disadvantages of this practice. I will take the examples of the USA and France. In the first place, studying abroad has some advantages. Firstly, learning a second language will allow you to represent yourself as a bilingual individual on your CV, for example, because presently, the knowledge of English is necessary in the world. Secondly, as an international student you will have more opportunities after university because you can find a job in two countries and choose where you can have more money, where you want to live, ... For example, employees are better paid in the USA than in France. But, in the second place there are disadvantages to studying in another country. Firstly, there are different ways of life, habits, and cultures between the United States of America and France, for example. Secondly, we can make a comparison between universities in two different countries, one where it is free like in France, and one where it is really expensive like in the USA. It is an example of what sacrifices you will have to make to study in another country. To finish, studying abroad can be a really good experience, but it is necessary to have a project.

One of the less important subjects in schools is music, which plays a key role in waking students' emotions and teaching them to think much more deeply - in a roundabout kind of way. What is more, music helps us to understand things around us and finally, it boosts your brain activity. To put it in another way, schools try to find talents throughout this method of learning. However, there are different approaches from schools in the learning of music. Approximately 35 per cent of schools require playing a musical instrument as well. To be more precise, all students in the class have to play a musical instrument. Conversely, the rest of the schools do not require their students to play a musical instrument. A good illustration of this is in primary schools, where their students are prepared for a higher level of education such as university or high school. From the arguments stated above, I see a reason to give students a choice, whether they want to learn music and simultaneously play a musical instrument or not. If I were in the position of the director of a school, I would give them a choice. From my view, playing a musical instrument should be optional and studying music should be considered only for students up to third grade in primary schools.

There is a heated debate among university students if it is better to live on their own or live with their parents while they study. To put it simply, living on your own has its advantages and disadvantages as well as living with your family. There's a lot to take in about what each group of students prefer while studying at university. So, let's unpack closely both groups of students to uncover it. The first group of students, whose choice was to live on their own, depend on a budget to live. A good illustration of this is to pay for the rent of the house they live in. What is more, this includes approximately 40 per cent of their income. Simultaneously, there are other payments you need to think about before you decide on how you deal with your money. By and large, your monthly income must cover all needs of your life such as travel to school, food, household. Conversely, those who decided to stay with their families while studying do not need to prioritize their budget like those who live on their own. This means in a practical terms that you do not pay for all the necessities of daily life. However, a contribution is expected in some cases. Furthermore, the disadvantage of staying with your family would shorten your time for study in comparison to others.

Big Ben is open daily from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. You can visit it, but you have to pay to get in it. Also, you can shop for everything you want on a very cheap street. It is very close to most of the accommodation in the city. You don't need to take a taxi. Please, if you want to visit some parks, pay attention and use the wastebasket to dispose of your waste. If you put it on the floor, you will receive a fine. At night the stars shine, so do the pubs. You can find many different bars around the city.

Thanks for your letter. As you wrote in your last letter, I started at school on the same day. The first day at school was so tiring and long, as usual. To give a simple reason for this, we spent a lot of time receiving school textbooks and other materials. Furthermore, we had to fill in lots of forms I did not understand, to give an illustration, my parents' phone number in case something happens. As you said, I fight in the same way as you, with the same subject you mentioned. However, I tried to develop my skills in English with my penfriend, but we stopped writing all of a sudden.

Holidays are of immeasurable importance to students. It gives them the unique opportunity to look back on the past year. In addition to that, they can contemplate their future and think about their future life. In the case that you have the possibility to drive or even fly somewhere beautiful, you might have an unforgettable time. This was the case two years ago when I went to Bali. At this time my uncle lived in Singapore and we gave him a flying visit, on our way to Bali. I did not see much of the city due to the fact that we were there just for two days, but we saw the famous flower garden, as well as all the zillion ships approaching the harbor. What stayed in my head the most was all that smog; it seemed like clouds with the exception that it was dark gray and the humidity in the air was devastating. There can be no doubt that these conditions are detrimental to your health. Seeing this has quite a different effect on me and on my way of thinking. It was of crucial importance to see such an event out of the vicinity. Despite it not being a beautiful event, it was the most inspiring holiday I ever had. I will never forget it. Additionally, it was the longest distance I ever traveled, just to see this calamity. It was incredible.

The aim of the following review is to analyse the impact of Write and Improve's page on the student's learning progress. Let's dive into the topic starting from the visual impact of the page. What stands out is a perfectly balanced page. The choice of light colors (with hints of black ink here and there), makes it easier to navigate among tasks and assignments. Each category contains a selection of activities dedicated to all learners, from elementary to advanced. Each category includes a whole plethora of topics raging from essays to snackable articles, and letters to choose from. I think the page is a game changer, a quantum leap forward, as it has prominently revolutionized the way we approach writing in English. No more loads of money spent on pricey private teachers. No more issues with timings and schedules. Not only is the service custom tailored and available 24 hours a day, but it also gives you a feedback in a blink of an eye. What I find less appealing though, relates to its usage on mobile phones, which I find slightly old style and uncomfortable. Secondly, the automatic approach to all sorts of human expression in the realm of literature may result in shallowness and emptiness. In conclusion, I recommend students to use it as a secondary tool.

Video games, radio waves, Wi-Fi waves, and artificial intelligence; we have little information about their impact or effects. You hear many people saying, "These are alien tools to control us and dominate the world" and some other people who believe in science say, "We don't have any information now because these are new technologies." We cannot agree with any of them because their reasons don't make sense. We have a lot of studies on the internet from high level universities in Japan, America, and Spain, and the scientists say that if you use anything more than in a regular way, maybe you can get side-effects. I have an opinion about this problem. We can say video games are good and bad at the same time. Let me explain my pet theory. We can say video games are good when they have games for the brain or you can think when you are playing, and we can say they are bad when you are not thinking and wasting a lot of time with nothing. Be a pragmatic person and don't waste your time.

Of course, animals belong in nature, but we are humans and being humans you have that feeling of "I want to explore something new." So we are interested in animals and insects and we should have some animals beside us in cities, but that doesn't mean we should keep animals in small and dirty cages without food and water. We are not monsters and they have souls, we should take care of them. I accept the concept of zoos for one reason, it is for scientific research and to fire up people's minds to explore this wonderful world. We are dealing with a moral issue with animals. The problem with animals is more than a social issue. I repeat it again, we should take care of animals. If we can't be patient and we need zoos, we should provide them with huge rooms to play in and provide sufficient quantities of water and food, and we should take care of them again.

I think studying abroad is better than studying locally for many reasons. A normal person who studies in their country has a lot of assistance because of available transport and they are in the same culture with the same people, and everything is easy for them. So they can't have a feeling of responsibility and independence. On the other hand, we have students studying in other countries; they have a lot of risks and dangers. They should find work to provide for themselves and they work hard to take care of their studies and their work. And any person who can take this journey can face up to their problems in future because they faced hard things in their studies, they can deal with stress and pressure. At the end, studying abroad or studying locally is a journey in our life. We should deal with it. And I finish here, see you later.

I live in a rural area, it's a small town and there isn't much medical attention. There are only two doctors and in the only pharmacy there isn't enough medicine. Here people are very poor and can't pay for good medical attention, but this isn't the only place with low resources. In Mexico 85% of the of population suffer economic problems but that's not the most disappointing, the really worrying thing is that the medical attention that the government brings to its society is very limited. Most doctors in Mexico find work in a job that allows them have a good economic level and that is achieved by working in the city and not in the rural areas. The reason for this problem is that the government doesn't pay a living wage so that there aren't enough doctors and medical attention in the areas of greatest need. I think that if the corresponding authority focuses on building more health centers and hiring more doctors with a good salary perhaps they would enjoy working in these places.

School is about to change! Are you one of those people who is bored of going to school? If you answer is yes, then maybe you should keep reading. What bores me most about school is having to stay in the same old classroom and listen to the teachers without getting a single thing. Well, if you feel the same as I do then let me tell you that things are about to change because in the foreseeable future we might take classes in our bedroom with special devices full of advanced technology. However, the greatest thing would be that we will not even have to waste time getting to school and driving all the way back home, and although there might be quite a lot of changes, one thing that will always be true about school is that it will invariably remain a place to learn brand new topics every day. In conclusion, there is nothing in the world like going to school and meeting up with both your friends and favorite teachers. So are we sure we crave school to be different? What is your take on it?

Learning English is the best! Learning English might sound dull, but have you ever thought about the opportunities that it can give you? If you have not done that then I recommend that you keep reading. One of the cool things about learning English is that not only does it compel you to look at things from another perspective but it also makes you realize how amazing the path of learning another language is. However, the main reason why learning English is so relevant to me is because thanks to the fact that it is both a universal language and a great asset, I will be able to get a better job in the foreseeable future. Besides, learning a new language can actually be amusing! You can learn not only with songs but also with series. How amazing does that sound? In conclusion, we can all have several reasons for learning English, but we should not lose sight of how essential it is to learn it. Even if you do not like it, I am sure you will find it at least interesting. So what are you waiting for to learn it?

The face of tourism will be new; maybe we can go to London through virtual reality.

Schools are the concept of learning. When you talk about school you talk about teaching us science. The future is a bright and dark place at the same time because we have seen in the news how artificial intelligence improves every single day, and this is good on the technical side but is scary on the job side. I think schools should improve their subjects to convenient with new technologies and we should our ability to learn on the internet because it is really important to get a job in the new world, the world of artificial intelligence.

I think working hard to get a lot of money is the correct thing to do, but if that does damage to your body or general health that is a huge mistake. We should work hard and do good as well as we can because the Earth is not a peaceful place.

For me music is very important. Music can change my mood and my feelings. When I was 14 years old I learned to play guitar. It was an amazing experience. It was hard but I tried to practise every day until I was able to play many songs. I love music and maybe one day I would like to learn to play the piano. When I was in high school I had a music teacher and he taught to me to play the flute. I would have liked him to teach us to play other musical instruments. In some schools it is an obligation to take music classes and learn to play a musical instrument. I don't totally agree with this option, I think that learning music is about feelings, passion, love and dedication and not obligations and duty. Not all people have the skills to learn about music and many don't have any interest in studying music. Music, sports and art aren't school subjects or obligations, they are like hobbies that help your life to be more comfortable.

I love doing exercise, it is my way to maintain my mental health. I do exercise quite often, about 4 or 5 times a week for 1 or 2 hours. I don't like gym's but sometimes I do exercise in my house, like yoga or strength training, but I prefer doing exercise outside. I love running or going trekking outside, to be in nature with a spectacular view of trees, lakes and birds is the best, and when I have the chance to do rock climbing or to climb a big mountain I don't lose the opportunity.

I don't have a lot free time, but when I have it, I like reading, cooking and going hiking. Reading is the activity that I do most, because it doesn't require much, but cooking and hiking are activities that require more time and resources, so I do these activities at least once a month. I like all these activities because they make me feel free, make me feel strong and allow me to get to know new places, real or fantastic places. Actually, yesterday I submerged into a new exotic and fantastic place during my reading.

In my view, every child should play the proper video game for his age. You can't give an 18+ game to a child. Also, I think that such video games like shooting or fighting are not appropriate for children at any age. I know cases where the child grew up to be a violent person and where that even put him in prison. I really think that a child should play video games which will help him to evolve and become a better person. As a second view, too many video games affect anyone. After a long period you wouldn't be able to see straight and your health will also be affected. I would end with my strong opinion that in childhood every parent must educate their child to spend more time socializing in real life, to play, to evolve, and to study, not to play video games all day in the house.

In my view, zoos are places for people to see what wild animals look like in reality. When I was at any zoo the first idea that came into my mind was to see a real tiger or a real monkey, not to learn about how they live or feed. But if you put it like that, from zoos you can learn a lot of things about animals if you read the signs. Also, you can read about how wild animals live and feed on the internet, it's not necessary to keep some animals in captivity to learn about them. The way I see it, zoos don't keep animals in captivity to learn more about them. The animals are kept in captivity for money. If people weren't interested in seeing animals in flesh and bones, they wouldn't be kept in captivity. This whole debate about zoos and wild animals comes down to money.

The way I see it is if in your country you can't get a proper education, then the best thing to do is to study abroad. In Romania the best thing to do, based on the domain you want to study, is to go to another country, like England or Belgium. From my point of view, even in high school you can study in another country if you have some relatives there. If you don't have someone there, then it is quite dangerous because you can lose yourself. In university you are older and the probability to lose yourself is smaller. Also, in other countries you can study less and better. England is in this case the best country for a good faculty. If I have to compare, in Romania you are studying seven subjects in one semester, but in England you have to study four subjects in each semester. So, to end this discussion, if your country has a poor education system, than you must update your alternatives.

I am writing to apologize to you because I did not reply immediately to your letter. However, I was on holiday for three weeks with my new girlfriend. You asked me in your last letter about a review of a movie I love the most. Well, the film was written by well-known filmmaker Clint Eastwood. The movie is called Letters from Iwo Gima. It is about ordinary men who were sent to fight in a nonsensical war. On one side, many of them died on the battlefield. On the other side, lots of them committed suicide. The key point of the story is, before they died, everyone wrote letters to their family members, relatives or loved ones. These letters had never been sent off. Instead, they had been hidden in the caves on the island and found after 50 years. Clint Eastwood wrote the movie based on those letters. It is a real story that makes you feel you are with those soldiers who died in a terrible war. I do hope you will be amazed by the story and the reality that comes from the letters. We can not imagine that in a real situation.

Last summer, I spent my holiday in Tenerife. I was the best holiday I had until now. I stayed at Udalla Park Hotel. It was ten minutes from the Playa de las Americas, the best beach on Tenerife. We visited all the top-10 attractions of Tenerife. From the first day on the island we had our visiting schedule fixed. In the first four days we visited Loro Park which is the best park I have ever seen, Monkey Park, where we played with animals like monkeys or lizards, Mount Teide, which had a great view and Siam Park, the best aqua park in the world. Most of our time we spent visiting all the parts of the island. We rented a car and we drove on all the roads of the island. It was the best holiday I have ever had because besides the great beaches we had a lot of touristic points to visit and we spent a lot of time driving around the island.

A lot of things are more important than exercising. With exercise we improve and maintain our health. For a healthy mind you need a healthy body, but there are more important things than exercising, like faith, family, studies, and many other things. For example, you can't have a healthy life without your family or friends. If you are lonely there will be an 80% chance of developing a depression. After the depression you will win a good prize to the obese phase. A healthy life without faith is impossible because you will meet a lot of problems in life and faith will keep you moving forward. In some problems without faith you can go mad and forget about yourself. Last but not least, a healthy life without studies is impossible. You must finish your studies to get a diploma and get hired to have a salary. You can't live without money and you can't have a well-paid job without your diploma.

I have to admit I am a bit surprised by your letter. A birthday celebration in your country seems to be a bit boring. People usually celebrate their birthday differently and unusually in our country. We are the nation of improvisations. However, a birthday is not an exception. To give an illustration, I celebrated my last birthday at a campsite with my best friends from work. Someone decided to run a marathon or to climb the peak of a mountain. By and large, your celebration depends on your expectations and the ideas you would like to experience. Not to forget, you are the only person to say how to celebrate your birthday.

I started to practise writing three months ago to prepare for the IELTS exam next summer, and now I am still a beginner where I wrote fifty paragraphs at that stage, and I plan to arrive at one hundred paragraphs before the exam date. After that, I started writing with the website Write and Improve in order to choose topics and the Grammarly App for proofreading, and I will watch some videos on YouTube about methods of developing writing skills and writing techniques for the IELTS exam. Honestly, I liked this experience as a practice, and I was not expecting it to be beautiful and enjoyable where I had little fear of learning it, but I am still at the beginning. Writing skills are very important for learning any language, specifically for whoever wants to continue studying, and for sure I recommend learning them.

I would like to write a report about Write and Improve. Since my English teacher recommended me to study with this tool, I have practiced my writing skills to improve them. As a result, I like this system. Firstly, I can try a lot of tasks to improve my English writing skills. After making a sentence, I can check my mistakes by sending it to Write and Improve. My mistakes are highlighted, so I know where I made a mistake in my sentence and I can correct my answer. I like the fact that I can study by myself. Secondly, my sentence is corrected immediately by this tool, so it is a useful tool for me. Thirdly, the cost is free though there are a lot of questions which are available. On the other hand, I don't like one point, the system sometimes made a mistake. I hope this program will get better than now. In summary, I usually use Write and Improve. I think it's a useful application. I would strongly recommend my friends to use it.

I think it depends on the teachers. If the teachers are suitable for me, I want to learn from them for a long time. In this case, I can understand what they teach smoothly and I feel that my ability will be progressing. On the other hand, I want to have new teachers if I feel that the current teachers are not good for me. By changing to new teachers, I may understand them well and I feel that his class is enjoyable. Changing to new teachers also gives me a chance to get a new way of thinking. As a result, I think about my future and have a clear image of my future. In summary, changing to new teachers has a positive aspect and a negative aspect in each case. Therefore, I don't insist on one aspect and I think I should choose the best one when I choose teachers. As a result, I think I can get a good education.

I am a teacher and I had this experience in my studies as a student and my career as a teacher. First, as a student you have to know and learn about the different methods of studying and building learning skills from more than one teacher, where every teacher has a special way of teaching. Then that experience makes your learning more flexible and enables you to learn more, whatever the difficulties. Second, even with a weak teacher you will be able to learn by yourself, specifically with the Internet, which has brought a major revolution in self-learning. And I always say to my students they can replace any teacher in their school with the Internet, where there are countless websites to study any material they want, either on YouTube or any learning platform in various fields. Learning from only one teacher makes a student passive in his learning and limits his ability to learn from a variety of sources. Finally, perhaps in primary school the children need one teacher in order to establish strong basics when learning to read and write.

I was playing video games in my teenage years, specifically PlayStation One, and it was very exciting at that time. And also there was a conflict with my mother because we playing more than four hours daily and she was very angry with us. So I understand the concerns of parents about children's behavior with video games, their addiction to it, and parents urging their children to find a balance in their life. Video games are very attractive to play and for me, I see playing them as a personal experience where affect to son of them negatively via spending many hours on it and that kind of gaming leads to a defect in balance, severe weakness in social communication, and lack of concentration. On the other hand, maybe video games increase programming skills and perhaps be in it benefit financial and therefore provide a profession and source of income. Now video games have become an industry that is loved by a large number of supporters around the world. So parents have to deal with it more realistically and try to be close to their children in order to limit the negative effects and support their hobbies without conflict.

Regarding keeping animals in zoos, I don't think it's really good because animals belong in nature and if you need to learn something about animals you can just read some specific books, search for the information on the internet, or watch some TV programmes about them. But it's true too that zoos are pretty good for basic information about animals, like their habitat or the food they eat, seen with your own eyes, but they should be in the countryside. I just think that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos because they aren't living as well in zoos as in their habitat. Take polar bears as an example, they can't live well in zoos because they are from the Antarctic or some nearby places, not from zoos that are in cities. And there are a lot of animals that don't eat as well as in their habitat because the food they eat isn't there.

Hello teacher, I know that school is starting and you told to me to write about this, so here I go. First, I'm pleased about being pretty good at some subjects, like English or maths, and this year I wanna try some new subjects that last year I couldn't try, like technology or music. As I said before, I am very good at English and maths, but the subjects that I wanna improve are Spanish language and scientific and chemical physics because they're a bit harder than the ones that I said before. So to achieve my goals I just told some friends that are pretty good at language that they could help me with those subjects. I even told my uncle to help me with scientific and chemical physics because he's a scientist and he's very good at it. So, teacher, that's what I'm going to do to improve my areas of learning and I have to end it here because I have to go to start it. Bye.

Write and Improve represents a great way to improve your English skills. It helps even your vocabulary. The best thing to do is to have a daily schedule to follow. You can write at least 30 rows a day. One of the best thing is to write a lot because when you are writing, you are studying how to express yourself and you are searching for new words and phrases. Write and Improve has its good points but it also has its weaknesses. You can spend too much time on the writing part and neglect the speaking, listening, or grammar parts. Practising writing you can improve your English a lot, but if you exaggerate, you can spend too much time on it and damage the other parts of English. Writing is important but don't forget about speaking, listening, reading, and the grammar parts.

In my view, the same teacher is good when you are in elementary school because you need a teacher and a role model. You need that teacher for at least 4 years. The teacher has to know you and your parents and why not, even your hobbies. He must teach you how to become responsible and how to take matters into your own hands. A different teacher also helps you a lot, because you get to know different views of life and different personalities. From every human being you can learn something good or bad. You can make a selection of your learning from all your teachers. To summarise, if you have the same teacher you can have a good role model and a good second parent, but if you have many different teachers, you will learn what diversity means and a lot of new visions about life .

In 2006, the government of Saudi Arabia launched the King Abdullah program for scholarships to study bachelor's, master's, and doctorates. So that programme made a lot of students in Saudi Arabia a golden opportunity abroad for studying where the conditions were very easy to study, such as in the United States or the United Kingdom, or some other countries. This program was a qualitative leap for the progress of education in Saudi Arabia and now there are thousands of graduates coming back after finishing their studies. So I see it as a great advantage for any student if he can study abroad, specifically in scientific fields, economics, or management. The advantages of studying abroad are many, like learning a new language, discovering new cultures and communities, and increase self-confidence and independence. Concerning the disadvantages, perhaps some students suffer from the distance from their family, therefore, feel depression and isolation leading to this negatively affecting their studies.

I just think that in the school of the future, the master classes will disappear and the teacher will no longer act only as a transmitter of knowledge, but will have as its main mission to guide the student through their own learning process. The curriculum will be personalized to the needs of each student and personal and practical skills will be valued more than academic content. The Internet will be the main source of knowledge, even more than the school, and English will be consolidated as the global language of teaching. Education will be more expensive and last a lifetime. The families without access to an education would start disappearing and even most families would have a better education for their kids or even adults. But, there will continue being a danger place for the smaller kids.

In the future, I think that college will be attended on the internet. In my view, college is optional, so you can have some courses online and you can save the time of going to class. In high school or lower, you need a good teacher, the student is not prepared to study by himself. So only in college I think it will be great in the future to implement a study-from-home college. Another thing that will appear in school will be new subjects to study because the old ones are outdated. In the digital era we need children to learn fast and only the useful parts, not the ones which will never be used. In my view, the old type of learning, with books, will still be used because I can't see a future without books.

An unhealthy lifestyle has begun to influence the life of students both at university and school. One of them is an inactive lifestyle. It indeed brings severe impacts on the students' lifestyle. Several efforts have been proposed, like one of them is forcing them to do sports activities at least 3 three times in a week. However, would it create such an impact? First of all, doing exercise is beneficial for the body as it can bring positive to the students and improve them physically and mentally. However, bear in mind that every student has their own right over their own body. They can do whatever they want with their bodies as they can choose whichever lifestyle they are going to implement as the responsibilities are on them. Forcing them contradicts their rights to their body autonomy. Therefore, encouraging them to do sports would be better than making it mandatory. Second of all, a healthy lifestyle is not all about physical activities such as doing sports or exercise. Doing sports is not the only one in order to have a healthy life. There are many other activities that can have the students reach a healthy life such as diet, food choices or meditation. Therefore, sports activities are not the only actions school can take but educating them to be healthy is also one of the solutions. Third of all, it is irrelevant to force the students to do sports three times a week. A healthy lifestyle is not defined by the quantity of exercises in a week done by a person. But it is more about the quality of the exercise. It would be less relevant to have exercise for three times in a week without having a good quality of activities than just once with impacts to the students. Besides, the students are generally busy with their own coursework and extracurricular activities as it becomes a hindrance for them to do exercise if this is being upheld. In conclusion, forcing students to do sports every week might bring a good impact on them. However, it contradicts their rights and potentially impedes their activities. Encouraging them to do exercise is actually more preferred than making it compulsory.

In one way, television is a good thing. With television we can educate children and even grown-ups. For children we can have some educational shows about maths, chemistry, or even physics. We can even concentrate on climate change and try to educate people from a young age to be responsible and to recycle. The most important television shows must be for education. On the other hand, we must have some entertainment on television, like comedy, drama, horror, or action movies. Television is about entertaining people, we must show the whole world that it's worth it to watch TV and if we are good in commercial we can even convince them that it's a must. To sum up all of this, I must add the fact that health is also important and we must exercise, so 24 hours of TV won't help us in this matter.

Learning English is a material that is essential to improve English skills. I use a lot of tools. There are sometimes things that could actually help me improve my English skills quickly, but it’s sometimes quite complicated. Write and Improve, which my friends recommended, helps me a lot. This tool is very helpful to me. Accordingly, I want to write a review about it. Write and Improve is an excellent tool to correct English sentences by using an AI algorithm. There are different tasks in it. There are many tasks and you can choose which one you prefer. Once done with the task, you can submit it and they will give your score accordingly. It also highlights the wrong sentences. Moreover, it suggests what to correct. There are several levels in it and it can be used by various English learners. It is definitely a useful tool, but it is not a perfect one. For example, Write and Improve corrects our submission and it gives us some feedback. However, it's difficult to know the wrong parts clearly. Additionally, our scores are defined in each level even if the answers are excellent. I hope these points will be improved. In summary, I am writing a review about Write and Improve. It's an excellent and useful tool for English learners. I hope many people use this tool and it will be improved continuously.

Hi Jeff, How have you been? I went to a concert last week. The artist was Misia, who is one of the best singers in Japan.

Of course, I accepted his proposal and I was excited. While I saw her performance, I couldn't suppress my emotion. Therefore, I was standing during the concert.

Hello teacher, As today we had a class discussion about healthy life, I realize that doing exercise is necessary to have a healthy life, but even at that point, there are more important things than a healthy life, like family, friends, and more... But, without a healthy life you couldn't live that much to appreciate those points that I mentioned before. So what I'm thinking is... a healthy life is pretty good, but even in the good moments of that life, it could let you down and may make you start again all the way up. As you probably know, there are very addictive things, like biscuits or other kind of sweets that could make you lose your progress on your work to have a healthy life that aren't that bad. But I just really think that taking breaks to eat some sweets isn't bad. I mean, if you have a healthy life and you think that you would like some sweets, but you are scared about ruining that effort, don't worry, just eat them in very small quantities.... Get rekt teacher.

Personally, I think that both health and money are important but in different ways. But to be healthy is more important because you can make a lot of money if you are healthy. But if you have problems, then you have to spend money for your health and to make things worse, you can't work as you used to. I am sure that if you have a good health status, money will come through hard work, but if you are ill then you will have problems with both. If we want to discuss the money subject, we must admit that money helps you to keep healthy because you must go to the doctor's annually and you must spend some money on health care. Money also helps us to have a good education. Let's admit it, everyone needs money to study at a good school. To summarise, you need money to keep your health and education at higher standards and you need health to produce money.

My life experience enabled me to conclude that material possessions offer temporary solace; due to my perseverance in self-improvement and investment in my education. I broadened my perspective to the point of being able to shift dramatically from materialistic to spiritual. This spiritual awakening enabled me to become successful in determining the right and wrong aspects of human activity. Never have I been more convinced of the detrimental effects of mobile phones on human well-being than in current reality, when our society is facing the unprecedented spike in mental health issues, single-person households, divorce rates, addictions, broken homes, and suicide rates, not to mention security concerns related to mental exhaustion that prompts hazardous behaviors in humans. Moreover, a national inquiry into effects of mobile phones on toddlers aged one to three years old carried out in 2006 by the National Institute of Science reveals that pupils engaged in online activity for more than two hours a day demonstrate shorter brain waves compared to their counterparts who were not exposed to such stimulation. Additionally, the first group reports a considerable increase in self-esteem and academic achievement. For this reason, I urge you to implement the prohibition of mobile devices in public facilities. Should any additional detail be required, I would be delighted to provide more information backed by in-depth scientific insights to support my theory. Yours faithfully Maddalena

About having different teachers every year. I'm thinking that having a new teacher is better than having the same teacher for many years. That's because having the same teacher every year could make students want to stop with school, because most of them want a new teacher every year. Or if it cannot be a new one, one teacher that they had, but not repeating the same teacher, and that's even more boring than trying a new teacher every year. Because if they have the same teacher every year, the students could play some tricks on the teacher, as I know most students would try to look better to a new teacher because.. they're new. Even with the same teacher they could look better to the teacher but that's less likely to happen. And it depends on the time of the year, because if it's in the first term, they wouldn't take a lot of care.

If you are reading this, it is because you want to know my reasons for learning English, how curious. Well, here you can read about it. My reasons for learning English. As you can read in the title, I'm talking about my reasons for studying English. I study English because for the future I'll need it yes or yes. Well, if I want to travel to another country where I don't know how to speak that foreign language, English is the universal language, so I could talk more easily in that country and faster than spending many months or even years on learning that language. And for most of the jobs, well, in the country that I'm living in, you should have a B1 in English to be able to go that job. So, as you can see, English is more important than you thought.

Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? Well, yes it is, as in these days, knowing a foreign language is one of the most important things that you need, because without it, you cannot do the things you can do if you know a language. For example, for travelling it's easier to speak clearly with someone in a restaurant, a hotel, or even in someone's own house. As foreign languages were less studied in the past, travelling to another country was one of the most difficult things and people often got stuck in a country because they didn't know how to speak another language. So, I really think that it is important to speak a foreign language. So traveling or getting a job would be a lot easier, and you can even teach people a foreign language.

As in this ztker question, I really think that studying in another country depends on your English level, (it does not always need to be English, but it's most common, yes) because if you don't know that foreign language, English could save you. But schools, schools, could be a very different thing, for example. If you explode you die you know?.,. now on to the real question, school could be very different, for example, if you are from Spain and you want to go to another country it could be very hard for you to leave your life behind, your friends... And you know, most of the kids of many schools, when a new student comes they like to demonstrate who the "leader" is and if the new student demonstrates they are better than them, they mo like to rage and try to bully, but the thing they don't know is that they look kinda weird..

My reason for learning English is for work and everything. I must be a good English speaker if I want to have a well-paid job and if I want to have a good and a fluent discussion in another country. The way I see it, if you want a well-paid job you must know 2 or even 3 foreign languages. English has become mandatory. In some countries if you want to work as a cashier, you must know English, so English is something that an employer expects you to have from your birth. In the future, I think that English will be an important subject like math or something like that. In some businesses in Romania you can speak English and everything will be fine. You don't have to speak good Romanian. In the end you must learn English.

In the past, all countries didn't have so much freedom. All people didn't have the chance to visit other countries. Then only the best students knew a foreign language, only for them was it necessary. Now things have changed. To succeed in life you must know two foreign languages. We can count English because English is a must. English is a mandatory foreign language, even a cashier must know a little English. Nowadays, if you know 3 foreign languages then you are prepared to change even your working field. It's important to know a foreign language because in the past people were limited to working in their countries and there were a few of them who had the opportunity to work with different countries, but now everyone is free to work in a different country. So, if you want a good career you must know two foreign languages.

Hi Alex, How are you today? I hope you are still well. I watched my favorite film with my girlfriend yesterday and I really want to recommend watching it. This film is of the romantic genre, of which you tell me all day that you love this category. Also, it has all of the elements that you want, such as teenage love, romantic music, many beautiful actors, and a happy ending. Furthermore, I and my girlfriend had to replay it almost 5 times because the highlight is very moving, which made us hug each other and cry loudly.

Hi Ana, As you heard from my mother, I'm actually studying English. The reason why I do it is that our company became globalized.

I’m writing to you to talk about university life. When we discuss school life, it’s difficult to answer the question below. Which university do you think is better for you to choose, the one far away or the one near you? I think there are strong points and weak points for each of them. Firstly, I'll explain about when students live in a remote location to go to a university. By living there, they have to do various kinds of tasks by themselves. As a result, they will change their mind and they can prepare to become fully - fledged members of society. On the other hand, their parents have to have a certain financial burden . Secondly, I’d like to have any opinions about when students live in their family's house. They have more free time than the students who live in a remote place, because their parents’ support daily housework. Moreover, there is no need of extra living fees by staying with their own family. Therefore, they don’t need to work hard to support the family budget. As a result, they can have more experiences. This will affect their future life. When I went to university, I lived in a remote place. I could change my mind by doing things by myself. Both have a strong point and a weak point, but I recommend the former one in the view of my experience.

I think that when you get used to someone or some place, you feel too comfortable and you run the risk of being reckless. But when you're facing new paths or things, you are forced to be alert and you´ll probably think that you have to show your best to give the best impression of yourself. So, if you´re having lessons with the same teacher for a long time, the comfort that this brings to you won´t challenge you to surprise him, because you already know each other. He already knows what you´re good at and in which areas you need improvements. Looking at it this way, it is an advantage because he can work on your flaws and just ensure your qualities. The new teacher is going to spend more time with you to get to know you before he can do what your last teacher was doing. But if teachers communicate with each other and share knowledge, this time of recognition could be decreased.

About health or wealth Health is the most important thing in your life, but without money, there's no health you can you can keep safe, there's no health you can keep safe, being a healthy man or woman feels very good, but you know, you'd probably say " I'd rather be a wealthy human because you can pay for more important things, like medicine or vegetables " . But we both know that the wealthiest people don't eat a lot of food that the? Easy, I don't really care about money. Yes, it bought me many things that I like, and I prefer a healthy life to a wealthy one. Another thing that could happen to you if you're wealthy is that people may be your " friend " only because you have money, they don't care for you or wouldn't help you if you were in trouble. So, what I'm saying is that there is a lot of money in the world, but there is only one life.

Hello there!! In your last email, you asked me, " Hey, what's your favourite film? Mine's Star Wars " . Now, I've been deciding about which one film is my favourite, because you know, I love watching films so I have watched like 200. After thinking about it, I've decided that my favourite one is " James Bond, agent 007 " . Why?, may you ask. Simply, I loved the VHS you sent to me with an original action film that now is not in the cinema. After seeing that film, I started loving action films, combined with detective ones, I really LOVE them. I really need to thank you for that VHS. See you soon!!:-)

About the future of travel. I think (well, I want) that in the future, cars and public transport, well, every vehicle, won't need fossil fuels. They should be electric cars, or vehicles that are made to float, using some very strong magnets in the road to make the car be repelled by the road to make it " float " . Because if in the road there is an N and in the car there is an N, the car would be repelled by the road. Or if not, it's easy to use electric cars. I mean, changing a fossil fuel engine for an engine that needs to be charged, like a mobile phone. That would be much much better than today's ones. I know that changing the fossil fuel engines of trucks for some electric engines wouldn't be as convenient as using the fossil fuel ones, but it's much better. So the pollution of the world would decrease, so global warming would even decrease too.

I guess that like any other activity, there have to be boundaries. And those boundaries have to be given to children by their parents. Playing video games too much could be harmful for their sight, could jeopardize their studies, their grades at school, and it is not good for their health. It´s because doctors do not recommend for our bodies to stay in the same position for so many hours. So, I think that playing video games can be a hobby and like any other hobby it shouldn't take up many hours of the day. They should play video games only if they´ve already done their homework, if they´ve already studied, and if they´ve already done their list of must-do chores of the day. There are other things that should be considered. There are very violent games that could affect children´s minds. So, the parents should be aware of that too and, from the time to time , they should just take a fast look at their children´s games.

I have recently been to a concert of classical music, it was pretty fun!! I really loved that moment, I went with some friends. If you are asking, it was a well-known music band in Spain, where I live, too. It surprises people more and more every time that that band announces a concert! The last time I went, I mean, after this time, they entered the scenario jumping out off a helicopter!! And this time, they paid for some dancers to represent a story while the music was playing. I couldn't believe that it was like a theatre but cooler! See you soon!

Nowadays, the Internet, social media, and television programmes are very important, but many people think that they are a big distraction for the young. But it all depends on the way that they take these advances. Currently there are thousands of entertainment channels, there are many channels for sport, cartoons, news, and a few channels for education. When the pandemic started all school classes were suspended and the television programs changed to be able to help to improve and continue with education. Many virtual education programmes were created and in this way the students could continue learning and teachers found a way to educate through television programs. So I think that technology is very important for future education, but it is very important too that we as a society teach children the right way to use social media, the Internet, and television programs.

I think that studying abroad can give you lots of great experiences and could also make you more independent. But I think that the biggest advantage is the opportunity of knowing yourself far away from the eyes of your parents, family, and friends. It gives you the freedom of discovering sides of yourself that you didn´t know of. Some of them, you will enjoy and some of them you won´t, but you can work on those that you don't like and make a better version of yourself. But there will also be the feeling of loneliness, especially in the first months. The knowledge along with the adventure is also a huge experience. The school´s structure and the educational system will be different from what you were used to and you will have to adjust yourself to this whole new world. Your schoolmates will probably be from different countries. So, the challenge of living together with people from different countries gives the opportunity of facing different opinions, cultures, and habits. This will give personal and professional growth. There is also the big opportunity of being fluent in a new language. This will improve your resumé and you will be a footstep ahead on the journey of finding a job.

For me it is very important to have an enjoyable place to work. In many office jobs the employees have cubicles and don't have the freedom to develop their skills. I think that it is necessary to have our own place to think and discover new ideas for the company, but it is important too that the boss always knows what their employees are doing while they are working. When the employees are at work, they usually spend their time with their co - workers talking about their life and problems until some things that are good for the employers. When you are in a job where you can talk with your co-workers, you are more comfortable and your performance is higher. For that reason, I would like to recommend and motivate all businessmen to take care of their employees and have a warm and creative place. With this energy, all workers will be able to be more efficient.

About television In my opinion, television is good most of the time, but it can make a person who really likes a program stay in front of the TV a lot, and that's bad. There are a lot of series that make small children act like if they were in a show, because many kids that don't know what they are doing, they act like in a reality show. Most of the time, it isn't bad, but there are some times that it can be bad. But there are many programs that 'educate' or, well, they try to. As an example, if we have to be at home for a long time without going to school and we can't make video calls with teachers, those programs do the work. But if you're more than 8 years old, it doesn't do the work very well, because it shows things that you may know at that age.

In technology, there are very good things, but every good thing has a bad one, or many bad ones. Books are really cool and it is free to get them from libraries and it is free to get them, when having a computer or tablet or any technological machine won't be free. Perhaps books are very good if you want to stay away from technology, and if you are searching for a calm place, libraries are the best ones. You can read, search for some books, and you can even do your homework if you want to, when with a computer or a tablet it can be harder to try to search for a book than getting a book physically if you don't know how to use them. And a good thing about technology is that most of books are available online to buy them, but having a book is a lot more comfortable for you. And reading for a long time in front of a screen makes you need to wear glasses over time, and with the books too. In my opinion, books should continue in libraries, schools, universities, ...

If I had to do a retrospective of my educational growth, I would say that I´m at a higher level in the following areas: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This is definitely because those are the subjects that I´m pleased with and because of that I spend more time studying them. I think it´s because I like to read the theory and then practise what I´ve learned. Furthermore, I enjoy the objectivity that comes with those subjects. So, for this year I just intend to keep following the same schedule and commitment that I had last year with those subjects. On the other hand, I didn´t spend enough time on studying the subjects that I don´t like, such as geography, history, and biology. This year, I have to try harder and spend at least 20 minutes per day on each subject. When I start studying them, I get really grumpy and this makes me give up. So, I intend to start my daily routine with a subject that I like, so that my mood and energy could increase enough to study those which I don´t like. I hope that this will end up being a good strategy.

Health is the fuel of life, in other words, health is what keeps you alive. So, the trick is finding a way to be healthier. That said, one of the most popular paths to reach health is through exercise. But, most people forget that this exercise needs to come along with healthy food as well. Furthermore, there is another thing which is forgotten and it plays an important role in our life: our mind. So, even though exercise is important to make our bodies stronger, the exercise itself is not enough. If your mind is not healthy, it won´t be able to establish a good connection with your body and so the exercise won´t provide you with all the benefits that it has. Therefore, the most important thing in life, from my point of view, is being able to build up a healthy mind and body. If you are able to keep it, you will have time and strength to chase other things, like success, happiness, and goals.

I was looking for an app where I could practise my English skills and fortunately I found "Write and Improve." This tool is very useful, here you can practise your writing. This page has different levels with different topics, you can choose the best option for you. I like this tool because I can write about a lot of themes and automatically this app quialifies the text and I can check my mistakes and amend it. Also this app shows me my level in each writing, but I don't like it when I write something wrong and the app doesn't suggest the correct grammar. That's the only bad thing. I recommend this tool because really it is very efficient, if you practise every day you can improve your level and also you can learn new vocabulary every single day. Also I want to recommend that if you are principiant you should choose the option "W&I Beginner" or "Just for fun" because you could write the text with easy words and with a more basic vocabulary. Anyway, this tool changed my life and I hope that this information will be useful to many people, I'm sure that you will improve your English skills soon.

The learning process can be jeopardized by a virtual education method, just like the relationship between students and teachers. The pandemic came to ensure that this is entirely true. Then, in the future, teachers and students will still have to go to an educational institution. However, theories and knowledge will be given to students in a completely different way. The technology will play an important part in the learning path, transforming it into a more interesting option for all. The three-dimensional virtual reality can be an extraordinary tool for subjects like art or history and, therefore, students will be able to experience tours of hundreds of museums in many different countries without leaving the classroom. It can also be added to biology. Mechanical animals, built with the latest technology, have a striking resemblance to the real ones. And with a hidden camera put inside their bodies, they can be inserted into a natural habitat and transmit videos to a computer. With this, students can learn how animals behave and live naturally without stressing them or destroying their environment. Video chats will also be included in students' daily routine for interviews around the world.

Television is often used as an entertainment tool, but it can also provide society with culture and knowledge in different fields and in an easier and more interesting way. For example, there are already cartoons which add educational cadres into their normal sequences or have their characters make educational statements. There has been a good response from parents who have been watching their children learn about numbers, colours, animals, new vocabulary, and so many other things. There are channels which are only committed to an interesting subject, such as history, animals, or technology. They provide plenty of documentaries, videos, and discussions about the most diverse topics. These can offer sometimes extra information for those who are already familiar with the subject or can be an introduction for those who didn´t know anything about it. When it comes to visual and auditive information, sometimes the brain captures and keeps it more easily. The real question is if the person is willing to spend his time on this type of channels.

Life is a precious gift given to us by God. The life span of any human being is unpredictable. Some people live a long life while others enjoy a short span in this world. It is a great experience to lead a long life, but I believe quantity of life should have less weight than the quality of time spent. It is undoubtedly true people who are living their life to the fullest are the happiest. Also, they are not dependent on others for financial or physical support in their lifetime. Firstly, it is important to be happy and healthy throughout life. People who have fewer expectations, like a long life, will try to live the time intensely following their dreams and experiencing happiness. For instance, going for vacations and travelling around the world frequently in a younger age present the feeling of excitement and energy in life, which can prove to be a stress buster and make a person happy. Secondly, living a short and fulfilling life gives the feeling of a satisfying life. It is always encouraging to have a life which is not dependent on anyone else either financially or physically. To illustrate, the human body starts deteriorating after a certain age and thus needs support for performing day to day activities. The person also becomes incapable of earning and is interdependent, which can inculcate the sense of loneliness in life. In conclusion, it is like two swords in a case. People living a long life can earn many relationships and experience the change in generations throughout their life span, whereas the one with short and lively life can live his/her life independently to the fullest. Therefore, it is in my opinion that shorter and fulfilling life is better than a calm long life.

Video games are a new form of entertainment in this era of technology, and I think they are a good resource to create worlds or scenes close to our reality. And we can learn from them, like programs used to learn driving, interactive games to learn other languages, and games focussed on developing specific skills. However, many of the most popular games are violent and demand so much time and money to make the user feel good or like "a winner" in order to keep him playing a lot of time and the video games company able to get more profits. On the other hand, time spent on video games is affecting the social skills of children, which makes it difficult to make friends, to be sociable, and to respect the rules at social places, keeping children away from each other because they do not know how to interact with other children. So, they would rather be in a comfortable place, at home and doing what they know, playing video games.

I went to a music concert last week with my parents and one of my cousins. It was a band formed by 5 amazing singers. Each one of them played at least 2 instruments. I´ve been listening to their songs since I was a child and I was always impressed by the harmonies that they make when they sing together. They are even more impressive alive. Besides those skills, their lyrics are the most sophisticated and deepest poetry I´ve ever heard. They also have stories that make you feel every single word like you were the one who wrote it. Because of all of this, they have been in so many soundtracks that I already lost count.

I am one of those people who prefer to sleep in a quiet and dark room. Besides, that room should be the perfect temperature, not too warm, neither too cold. Getting to sleep is a slightly difficult process for me, it takes me a lot of time if I am not really tired. I need a couple of good conditions to get to sleep, when I go to bed before sleeping, I need to read a bit, trying to relax my mind and get it away from light stimulus like a computer or cell phone. When my mind is relaxed I try to sleep hoping it won't be noisy, cold or warm, which disrupts my aim.

The essay is very interesting. I like to dream in several ways! When I am very tired I prefer to sleep in a dark room without any kind of noises. Otherwise I sleep listening to my favorite music. But the top, for me, is to sleep on the sofa while listening to blues music and with the candle's light for company! During summer holidays, when I go to the Mediterranean sea, I like to sleep on a beach chair too. These are my ways to sleep.

Well, l think that l will like the "dark and quiet room," it's pretty good. But it is mostly how sleepy you are and what your sleeping place (also known as sleeping bags and beds) is like. lf you are very sleepy and your sleeping place is very noisy, you will still fall fast asleep. But if you are not sleepy and someone makes you sleep, no matter how dark and quiet your sleeping place is, you will still find it hard to fall asleep. lf you have trouble falling asleep every night, try this: take out two dimes, when you go to sleep, place the two dimes on your eye lids, the dime can help you fall asleep. But it has some major problems too, like you can't use this method when you're sleeping sideways. So, l don't really recommend you to do it. But if you really need it, you can only sleep with your face facing up at the ceiling.

In order to understand about life, humans have created different methods to keep and study several organisms, from microbial culture plates to zoos. Zoos are not only to help to understand how several animals behave but to help to keep animals in danger of being hunted safe, or because their habitats have been destroyed. Besides, in many zoos, environmental conditions are very similar to a wild environment, stimulating animals to reproduce and keeping the offspring away from danger until they reach the adequate age to put them in wild habitats. At the same time, zoos have been a good way to show people, the value and importance of nature, and they have brought all ecosystems and wildlife together in a little space and to have allow being close and aware to different life forms. However, many zoos do not have space and resources enough to offer a good life to all animals. Some animals have shown behavioural disorders after being locked up, like elephants and gorillas. So, I think humanity should strive to preserve natural spaces where animals live and try to make people aware of natural conservation and its impact on their lives.

In my opinion, no, not everyone should study music because of a lot of reasons. One of them is not every culture accepts music, like Muslim countries, because music is prohibited in Islam so Muslims do not listen to music or make it or even teach it for the previous reason. No one can ignore the benefits of studying music because it is very useful for mental health and we live in a world that does not care about our soul or our mentality, just money, and everything is money and that returns damage to our health. Music is the food of our souls, the soft power of us and it's our energy so we need to make our effort to declare it to all the people on this planet and maybe on another planet. Why not? I am finished but that is for you guys. Thank you everyone. thank you.

There are many resources on the internet to improve your English learning process, one of them is Write and Improve.

Hi Leyla, I'm really sorry that l couldn't go to your party yesterday. Let me explain why l couldn't go to your party. First, l already had a plan to carry out yesterday and l didn't seem to see that your birthday was coming. Let's just say that it's mostly because you didn't tell me that your birthday was coming soon. lf you had told me earlier, maybe l could have saved 1-2 hours for your birthday and moved some plans to today. And l suddenly got a cold at that time, so that's why l couldn't go to your party. What happened at the party? Do you have a "pinata" for one of your party games? lf you have it, please send some candy and toys from the "pinata" to me, okay? Since l didn't get to go to your birthday, l will invite you to a really good movie that's called, Chinatown Detectives. lt will be a little confusing because it has Japanese, Chinese and English too. But it's mostly Chinese. Hope you can forgive me about the birthday thing! Your friend, Kenneth

The castle has 365 windows, one for each day of the years. In Giove, you can eat in several typical restaurants but, there are no souvenir shops or other types of shops.

Children love video games and while some parents think that they may have positive results for their children, some others judge them in a negative way. In my opinion, there is always good and bad in everything, maybe not in equal parts, but still. Nowadays, children quite no longer play outside in the playground. Forced by this situation, video games may be one of the few opportunities for children to play and do it with others. Obviously, children tend to spend lots of time with computer games, therefore, parents are required to watch over them and be the time-keeper. If children are allowed to spend a certain time-frame to play and if parents check carefully what their children play, video games are not that bad. Children can learn strategy as well as teamwork and last but not least, they can easily learn English since most of the video games are released in English. As far as I can say, I am pro video games, as long as children are not left alone and unguarded. In such a case, video games can do more harm than any other games. Again, from my personal experience, I can state that video games for children can help them study and learn in a different way.

Hi Dear David, I hope you are fine. Last week, I went to a concert of Larry Gowan and I have thought about you because I know you like this kind of music. You would have liked that very much! It was an amazing performance which lasted two hours. Gowan was born in Glasgow and he lives in Toronto. He is a fabulous musician, he plays the piano and the guitar, he dances, and he sings. During his show, he sung his best hits and many news songs. He was accompanied by his brother and other excellent musicians. Even though he is an English speaker, between each piece of music, he was talking in French with his public. It was wonderful. See you soon! Diane

This it's a very controversial theme because for me always telling the truth is very important but in some cases it's important to tell some lies. I think that it's a matter of perspective, there are many situations in daily life where you have to tell lies to be able to resolve the problem or achieve some things. Currently lies have become part of our life and behaviors and it's almost impossible not to tell any lie however insignificant it may be. I consider myself as an honest person and for me telling the truth in any moment is very important and necessary for my values but I had to tell lies in many situations too and not for that reason I think that I'm a bad person. For example: If in a work interview somebody asks me about my skills and my experience in the area for which I'm applying, I must tell the truth, even if I want to get the job. It's necessary to tell the truth to the interviewer because it won't be honest on my part to tell lies to get the job. Another example where maybe telling a lie is necessary is if my mother asks me to go to the supermarket to buy food and vegetables and I forgot to buy the potatoes, I have to tell her that, in the supermarket, there weren't any of the ones of she buys to cook, so, that lie doesn't affect anything and not for that reason, I'll be considered as a liar.

Studying abroad is a great opportunity and incredible experience. However, every student who wants to study in another country for a while, should consider many aspects before deciding to take this opportunity. The student should have a clear idea of why he wants to do it and if he really is ready for such an experience. Sometimes, the objective of studying abroad is not clear and students only think it is a journey to get to know another country. But he is there as a student, not as a tourist, so many difficulties come up which can make his time there hard. Besides, some students are not conscious that it is such a huge responsibility to study abroad by themselves and of all the people who support them, because students in another country represent their university, culture, and country. On the other hand, when the student decides to study abroad after thinking about all the responsibilities, costs, difficulties, and possible bad or good experiences, he is ready to really enjoy that opportunity as a student. The experience of studying abroad can be very gratifying and an educational experience like no other, but it can also be sometimes awkward, complicated, and lonely. If the student really wants to go outside his comfort zone and he is ready to face different situations then he should take that unique chance of studying abroad.

It was about 10 years ago. I was a teenager going through an important period of self-knowledge and acceptance of my flaws. I was starting to feel more like a woman than like a child, but I was very insecure about my physical attributes. I didn´t feel beautiful mostly because of my skin and my lean body. I thought that I didn´t draw attention of the good-looking guys and I was too bashful to make the first move. During that time, me and my family went on a vacation to a breathtaking hotel. Right there I felt so connected with nature and I must say that with myself as well. I caught the interest of three gorgeous guys and although I didn´t have anything with them, not even a kiss, it was really important for my self-esteem. I got out of there a new girl ready to embrace my new version or just my old one. It means that I was finally certain that I didn´t need anyone to tell me about my beauty. What really matters is what I feel inside, even though this sounds so cliché.

My favourite season of the year is summer. I think it is the best because the weather is nice and you can go to the beach and swim. I can swim with my friends and even with my family. In the summer, I like to drink a very cold cola. I like to eat ice cream. I like the summer because I do not have to wear winter clothes and I feel comfortable without them. The best reason why I like summer is that we do not have school. For me and other people summer is like a break from studying and I can rest and be ready for the next year. In summer it is always a holiday. That means that I can travel a lot to other countries and have fun there. I am longing for the summer and I hope it comes as soon as possible.

About doing volunteer work, I'm not against it, but if I ruled a high school I wouldn't force my students to do some volunteer work because helping isn't that important (for graduation). It can increase your final mark but, for example, if you try to do a volunteer job because you're forced to do it to graduate, then you can't go and then you couldn't do it and you fail because of that, it would make many people angry just for that reason. But in other parts doing volunteer work would help to make people charismatic and with eagerness to help more people without the wish of a reward, and that's good. Not in all cases does it go well, but I mean, doing that work is mostly common to foment the belief that helping could make more people happier. In conclusion, I wouldn't force students to do some volunteer work to graduate, but just to make their marks better.

l think that it's good for students that they have the same teachers and classmates every year, especially when they are in the high grades. Now let me say why at the downtown of this....... l found out that when you have a new teacher in your class, his or her teaching is different from your old teacher. This will cause the student to malfunction (here, malfunction means to be confused), and eventually this student will have a bad grade at the end of the trimester compared to the last trimester. You will probably think, Why? l will answer that for you. The teacher's teaching methods are not the same, which l already mentioned before. For example, l have this friend and his scores are very good. He almost got all A+s on every subject. But lately, his scores are going down very fast just because we got a new teacher. And whenever we get a test, his scores are pretty much Cs and Bs. Nowadays, people (including parents) will think that we will have more to learn when we have a new teacher every trimester. But that's actually just wrong. When they look at the grades, they will think twice about the new teacher thing. But when they caught on the next trimester, they will think that having a new teacher was still best. It just goes on and on and on. But finally, l still think that having the same teacher is the best.

Well, l agree that putting animals in a zoo is not very good, and l am pretty sure that some people around me think and feel the same too. There are a lot of scientists out there who think my point of view is right. Here's my proof: First, us humans are never satisfied by the things we've done and still want to get more answers from nature. But does it make things better? No. Our planet is just getting worse and worse. One time, our dear old America had its first species wiped out by humans. It happened in 2006, on July 24th, when the last red-tailed do-do bird had been shot down by Arnold Plamer. Now let's get to the topic. Keeping animals away from nature will make the animal lose its inherent abilities. Soon, it will not survive in this world anymore. Even tigers and lions that day will be killed by just a little insect. Then people will ask, "Why?" Easy, because they'd been in locked in cages so long, they even forgot how to use their hunting skills and how to survive in this "weak die, stong live" world.

It has been suggested by my teacher I start using Write and Improve in order to broaden my written English skills. This suggestion was perfectly on time as I was looking for a website which could help me improve my English writings. I was actually expecting to interact with a real person in order to discuss and eventually ask for feedback, I usually feel more comfortable this way. Instead Write and Improve does not foresee a direct human interaction. Despite this I can confirm that it is absolutely effective and very helpful. The website is always available, you do not require any appointment, just write and submit the exercise. The comments provided are very clear. Therefore, even if you don't talk to a real teacher, the feedback received is constructive and helpful as if you were in a classroom. Based on my personal experience, I will certainly recommend Write and Improve to my classmates, should they definitely wish to improve their written English.

The first discussion that appears is the importance and the utility of money. Money can give us stability, comfort, and the pleasure of conquering the most beautiful and unique material possessions in the world. But beauty is a subjective matter and if you don´t have enough time to enjoy the rewards of your richness, what is the point of having the biggest bank account? It is an unquestionable truth that money can´t buy health because our human body has still so many mysteries to solve. There are so many parts of our organism which are untouchable and that we can´t understand yet. So, money won´t matter when you have something that is not decipherable and is still out of the reach of human knowledge . On the other hand, if you are healthy, you can work hard to achieve the social status aimed at. Money is something tangible, but being healthy sometimes can be a goal impossible to achieve. So, if you could choose between richness and being healthy, what would it be?

In recent years some students, attending high school or university, have decided to study for some time in a foreign country instead of studying at home. As far as I can say it is a choice that weighs for better or worse in their future life, with probable regret if not taken in time Although nowadays it seems to be an easy choice to take, deciding to study in a foreign country is not that simple. First of all we have to consider the costs, which is quite high. Secondly, the psychological impact is a great component of the final result: students have to adapt to a new life and at the same time attend school, hopefully with good outcomes. Not an easy situation to cope with. On the other hand, the possibility to study abroad represents a great opportunity that someone shouldn't miss. Learning a foreign language in the country of origin is much better than studying it in another place, it gives the opportunity to improve it day-by-day with live language and apprehend at the same time the local way of living. A good start if envisioning to live abroad in the future. In conclusion, I think that the decision of studying abroad for some time, despite costing quite a lot of money, is a positive choice even just to consider the broader options of future jobs. And it still remains a great life lesson.

Furthermore, I have to lay down on my side to keep me away from that pain too.

I simply disregard those questions if I have the exact three pillows to make it through a peaceful night.

Now, let me get this straight. I did not make any mistakes on this trip. It was all my older brothers, Rodrick and Manny's fault. Summer came, and the school had been closed for summer vacation. I had planned my summer for playing video games, eating all kinds of snacks, and getting myself comfy in my new body blankie at home. But somehow, we ended up in Hawaii were the tropical season hit every year. The summer there is hot enough to let a person get a second degree sunburn for just lying down in the sun for thirty minutes. Now why do l say this? Because there was a resort in Hawaii. So we signed up for a thing called Boating Seas. After we found out, it turned out the Boating Seas thing was just a regular sea sighting. But when we came on the deck, Rodrick was nowhere to be found. And when we found him on the sea, he was as red as a lobster. We had to rub Popsicles on Rodrick's back so it would cool down a little. The worst part was sleeping. I had to sleep with Rodrick, who was sticky with Popsicle juice. It was not the best holiday, but l enjoyed it. I enjoyed it because l could eat Rodrick's snacks when he was sent to hospital.

Nowadays, I think it is important to tell the truth even though, sometimes, it is very hard to tell it. A lot of people believe it is important to tell it but how many are able to tell the truth ? You have to take care about the background who surrounds us because the truth can be a deadline. Nevertheless, lying is not very acceptable even if this is for good. In all cases, one day or another, the truth will be revealed and the lie can be the worst thing ever to do. People lie to hide the truth about themselves. Thinking is something not bad but when it reaches the person it can be something devastating. That's why you must be careful when you're lying to someone because you must be aware of the consequences. The truth can be very hard to face and people can be deeply hurt by those actions. However, some people don't really care and use it for themselves and that is really dangerous. Playing between both sides can one day or another go back to you really badly. And when some things come to you, you'd better be ready to get hit by the truth because if there is a lie the truth is never pretty and you can expect a happy ending. There will be a lot of suffering so it's better to tell the truth even if it hurts.

The Future of Travel is a prominent topic nowadays! Due to the pandemic, habits have changed a lot and while someone could still persist in believing that travelling will be as easy as in the past, some others are deeply aware of the dramatic changes in the whole world of travelling. Once, for example, we could plan to fly abroad for a holiday by simply choosing the country and reserving the flights, all of this without being forced to consider the quarantine required nowadays on the return home and the additional information about the health conditions that are compulsory if we want to take a plane. In light of this, the usual two weeks of summer vacation will no longer be enough. We will therefore need to add the days for the restrictions and, moreover, some other days for medical checks. On the other hand, we shall be able to travel safely in remote places such as on the peaks of mountains or on the outer sea maybe on a private sailing boat for a relaxing vacation. These two examples of holidays, very expensive today, will certainly be much cheaper in the future because they may be more in demand than in the past. Despite all this, even with many restrictions, travel will always remain one of the most attractive and richest human activities!

Personally, I'd prefer to live a long, calm life until 100 years old than live a short and exciting life. Well, depending on how many years you'd live I could change my opinion because a long life and a calm life is very good if you need to relax for studying or for work, but a short and exciting life could be very, very exciting. I'd rather have a long, calm life until 100 than a short life because I really prefer living relaxed days to exciting days because I won't know what could happen after that day, but living a calm life I could predict in some ways what could happen, and I prefer that, and in the job I like to work in, I could work more efficiently with the knowledge that in the next day it will go good. A bad point about living a long life is that if you do not like nothing in your life and you don't really like what you're doing that day-week-month-year, which could be very bad but you can end your life in some sort of ways, some more painful ways and others painless. If I had to choose one of them, I'd choose a long and calm life, as I am a relaxed person but unfortunately my life isn't that calm. So to try a calm life, I would choose a long and calm life.

Nowadays, technology develops very fast and humans find many new ways to travel. In my opinion, travel in the future will have some different points, but the basics of travel will be the same as now. Nowadays, you can easily find a video that talks about a place where you want to go. Humans are developing new virtual-reality devices such as the glasses with which you can see some place when you put them on. And you can go to see some place, but you just sit in the same place. 3D players can give you a view like looking at a real screen. Some people that like adventure would take the new ways to travel. But the rest will choose traditional travel because you can touch, smell, see, and feel everything around you. You do not feel air or cool weather when you travel through a 3D player. The way travel is organised will have some different points, such as the fact that people do not have to go to a travel agency to register. People who want to go somewhere can go on the internet to find the information about tours and very easily register for travelling.

Everyone wants to be healthy and wealthy. If you have both of them it is very good. If you are rich, you can buy anything you want. You can spend your money without considering it very much. If you are not rich, you will find it is difficult to satisfy your demands. Someone has to choose one of two things, health or wealth. I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Because if you are healthy you can do anything. You can study anything you want, and you can also help other people. If you are ill or not healthy you think about only one thing, which is how to get healthy and you cannot do anything else. If a man were ill for a long time, he would want to be dead. Some people do anything to be rich without considering their health and then they will spend all their money to buy medicines to keep their health.

Which future is there going to be for schools? This is a question that many of us ask ourselves nowadays. Will it be all different? Or will it remain the same? Based on what we experience today, the broad development of information technology makes us strongly believe that in a not-too-distant future, schools, as we know them today, will certainly disappear. For instance, we can figure that teachers will be replaced by artificial intelligence, which through a computer screen will teach students all over the world. While a totally computerized school might be the biggest change, we hope that at least the following two points will remain the same in the schools of the future; the curiosity of students for new topics and the opportunity for them to deepen their knowledge. In addition, hopefully, not losing school trips would keep helping students to explore the world and extend their horizon. In the end, although a change will certainly happen in the future, I strongly believe that schools will always remain the perfect setting to enhance the culture and broaden the education of all students.

Of course, there are things that are more important than exercise. But l'll just list some of them so this composition won't be too long. First, food. Food is the most important thing in our life. We use it as a fuel for our bodies, and it's not hard to find in our lives around us. Food is split into organic food (fruits and vegetables), complex carbohydrates (whole wheat pasta and bread), simple carbohydrates (milk, candy, and any kind of sugar), fats (proteins like meat and beans), and salt (which is likely in most of the food you eat). What l have mentioned are all the important substances that you must take every day. Second, your own life. l can say your life is the most important thing in the whole world. So that's why we always say don't take your life as a joke. If you are gone from this world, you'll miss it. Because you will not be in a palace. What you are seeing after you die is a completely dark place with nothing in it. If you have done something really good for the world, then you'll probably be a cat or a dog, or something like that. The last thing l'm gonna say is that there are a lot of things that are more important than exercising, but exercising itself is very important too.

Most medical doctors want to work in the big cities in order to make a lot of money or to have a good living. In my country many doctors want to work in the biggest and the fastest growing cities. They are struggling to remain in those cities. In the public health care it doesn't matter if you are working as a doctor in a big city or in a small. You have the same salary. Furthermore, if you work in a small city you will have less work to do and the rent will be cheaper but everyone prefers to stay in a good developed city even is they pay much more for it. I think this problem could be solved if the medical doctors are reassigned in cities that are close to their parents' house or if the reallocation is made based on grades. As a result you cannot choose to work in a hospital in a big city that has only medical doctors with 10 as a grade if you have a seven.

On our planet, lots of species are endangered, a considerable percentage of wild animals is at risk of extinction and under this light zoos seem to be the last resort for them to survive. Some people could disagree, those animals having been born free, they may argue that they should keep living that way. I like to think that wild species should spend their whole life in their native environment. I feel it's unnatural to force them to live in a different place outside of their native one. For instance, it is unacceptable that a lion accustomed to the heat of the savannah must be trapped in a zoo in a northern region. Or another example is to constrain dolphins to living in the limited area of a swimming pool. Although this might be the only possibility for a few animals not to become extinct, I still insist on the principle of letting them live wild and free. Zoos may be a nice place for children who can get to know creatures that they barely encounter in normal circumstances. Though good footage, recorded in the animals' original world could do the same. Once more, I keep thinking that animals should live in the spots where they were born, however, as long as human beings continue to disrespect other living beings on this planet, zoos might remain the only viable alternative to save those lives from extinction.

I have worked in all types of environments. As a programmer you can find a lot of working type of spaces when you change your job. At my first job I had a cubicle type of office. It was nice but I didn't like the fact that my co-workers from my left and right could see what was happening on my screen. I also worked in a full open space without anything to separate me from the other coworkers and it was awful. You don't have any privacy there. First of all, everyone sees what you have on your screen, second, the noise is horrible because you can hear every whisper, third, you feel like you are monitored from behind at every sound of footsteps. Finally, the best arrangement for a good and practical design for work is the enclosed one with small offices. I am currently working in this type of office and we are only six people in it. You can have your privacy and your peace there.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, An announcement has been spread among the citizens of this town stating an intended ban of mobile-phone use in various public areas. To express my objection, I am writing this letter to you; some viewpoints of other co-inhabitants can be found in the attached document. First of all, it is to be pointed out that banning the use of mobile phones is an unprecedented interference into people's human and civil rights, as far as I am concerned. Being convinced that the intention is only for sake of the town, I feel obliged to state that such a political step would doubtlessly lead to a protest. Eventually, some people, myself included, might feel so threatened that they would take the whole issue to the court. As a matter of fact, it would lead to financial burdens and farther dissatisfactions. Having mentioned the legal aspect of the case, the matter of safety deserves some attention as well. According to statistical evidence, the presence of a mobile phone has saved many lives. Especially in such a generally dangerous place like traffic, when accidents occur frequently, preventing people from having a mobile on them borders on an attack on their personal safety. As the majority of the town citizens would agree, common sense dictates that the ban would change the citizen's lives for the worse. As a competitive agenda, it is recommended to start a campaign which would encourage people to be more compassionate, polite and sympathetic with whom they share the space. Yours sincerely, KS

A struggle many people deal with nowadays is, whether to lead an intense, yet risky life, or if it were not better to stay safe and go through their days in a rather peaceful manner. It sounds like a Shakespearean dilemma. Let's take a closer look at the issue. It has to be considered that in the current times of social media, everybody's image of a fulfilled life may get blurred or even distorted. A significant fraction of people has experienced the FOMO syndrome, some may have fallen a victim to depression, both as a consequence of feeling a lack of meaning in life, according to psychologists. Even though this knowledge does not resolve the issue, it is a crucial prerequisite for finding the core of the matter. Neither the length, nor the intensity of life guarantee the personal feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that they do not equal any meaning. The former should be disregarded in the first place, as it is a significant figure after one's death. During their lives, people do not consider it. The intensity being mentioned, it can be generally assumed that an exciting experience may bring a certain sense of fulfillment, nonetheless, it has been proven that calm activities, such as meditation, increase one's contentment dramatically. As the whole subject is subjective to large extent, it is complicated to reach a general conclusion. All people have to learn to focus on themselves, what makes them happy and content in order to be able to leave this world peacefully.

The area that I come from is recognized for its food and one of the most praised types of food is called cheese bread. This is my favorite food.

It is a simple recipe, but the result takes my breath away.

I think that this requirement will help our society. We have got used to put only the career part in school but if we want to live as a healthy society, we must get used to teaching students how to be humans. The students must be taught how to help each other and how to take care of the environment. In my opinion, it's a great requirement but we must keep it as a reasonable priority. If a student hasn't completed one hundred percent of the task, I think it may be a good thing to close an eye of it. On the other hand, if the student hadn't done any volunteer work than I think it would be fair for him to get zero credits. A balance must be maintained between the teaching of subjects and teaching how to be human. In the end, I would like to highlight that this certain amount of volunteer work to graduate should be mandatory in any school.

In my view, I would love it if I could study some musical instrument in high school. It's a difficult thing to approach because you need students if you want to maintain this type of subject in school but you also can not force students from informatics specialization to do it. A solution could be to implement a different type of study class. A teacher could be paid to have some classes during the week and every student from every class or grade could attend. In this way we can satisfy the lack of students and the teacher could teach with enthusiasm. I think that students could develop great skills by learning to sing or an instrument. I saw a lot of people who developed good thinking by learning to sing or some instrument. They were literally learning easily everything at school. In the end, I would like to highlight that not all schools are willing to develop singing classes.

They are both good choices. It depends on each case because if your family has a lot of money then it is better for the student to stay somewhere alone. He could study better and could improve his experience in life. On the other hand, if the student stays with his family because they don't have money to pay his rent, it can be difficult to keep in touch with his classmates but he will be near his family and it could be easier for him in tough times. Every situation comes with its good parts and bad parts and it depends on the family's budget or on the family's perception. To put it in another way, the family could have the needed money but they think that their child could learn better under their eyes so he could be overseen or they literally don't want to waste the money on rent.

In general, office spaces are designed to match the room or the building bought or rented for work, they are generally not thought of in advance. The result is that some working spaces end up being smaller than a closet while some others turn out to be dispersive. In my opinion, the least effective arrangement between the two is the first one: working in a tight space, sometimes with not even natural daylight. It risks undermining firstly the employees' mood and secondly their health in general. For instance, keeping in the same room, computers, printers and workers can render the whole space too hot and too noisy, therefore not the ideal working place . Another aspect to consider, in separated offices, are the reduced exchanges amid colleagues. This might limit the leverage of the team-building culture. I would say that this kind of office arrangements might be fine only if secrecy is the priority for working purposes. I would definitely prefer working in a wide open space where interactions among co-workers are facilitated. The absence of walls is certainly a good choice in an office to foster a cooperative community as such, in an open space, in case of problems, assistance among colleagues is easier and in addition information runs faster than in separated rooms so that everyone in office is informed about what is going on. Open spaces help as well to create a friendlier working environment which enables workers to be at ease and contribute in a more positive way to the firm's objectives. In conclusion, although little spaces or separated spaces may respect the privacy of workers , in an open space, once more, I do believe that both the workers as well as the firm itself benefit from the arrangements in terms of results and wellbeing.

In my opinion, the books in schools and universities should be replaced completely by tablets and computers because of the reasons below. First, computers and tablets can store a huge number of books. One tablet can store as many books as a big library does. Second, students can find books on tablets 100 times faster than find books in libraries. Students can find books in other libraries in one second without going to those libraries. Third, students can write, draw, or do anything else on only one tablet. When they do something wrong, they can fix it easily by retyping or erasing the wrong things. Fourth, students do not have to bring so many books to school or university, it is convenient for them. Fifth, each country does not have to print so many books for students, it means that we can reduce the materials for making books. It will reduce the bad effects on the environment.

My English teacher has kindly requested us to produce a plan for the forthcoming new school year where we are going to highlight the subjects we love the most, the area we need to improve, and the actions we envision to take to achieve our objectives. I would start by saying that I have always loved attending school and studying a lot to broaden my horizons. Among the school subjects that I prefer the most are history and philosophy as they both represent the physical and psychological path of humanity . Being so passionate about them, I would like to attend a seminar about the medieval age arranged by the local Museum of Medieval History, while for philosophy I am planning to attend a online course so that I will be able to deepen my studies. Unlike history and philosophy, the classes that I prefer less are mathematics and geometry, which are as well the subjects that need to be improved. Mainly considering that they will be part of the school path for the next four years. In order to reach a good learning level, I have planned to pay for private classes in addition to those already foreseen at school. In conclusion, I hope to have identified the correct areas to improve and have identified the right ways to meet the objectives highlighted above in order to render this new school year as effective for myself as possible.

The economy is developing so fast and the way to organise a company is changing also. Some companies design their office as a closed space. On the other hand, some companies have an open design, in which there are no walls separating employees from their co-workers. In my opinion, the most effective is an open design. There are three reasons to support my opinion. First, managers of a company will manage their staff easier because they can see and monitor all the workers. They can see what workers are doing and the workers see their managers too, as a result, workers will focus on their work and produce more products. Second, the workers of company can easily contact with other workers to have more help. It will contribute to the teamwork and build the culture of the company. Third, it will reduce the cost of building an office because there is no need to spend money on building walls. The buildings that do not have separated walls will have more space for workers and will arrange the furniture and equipment more easily.

The medical profession should be a vocation. Despite this starting point, some doctors prefer choosing to work in big cities to gain a much higher salary. Due to this attitude, many places in the countryside suffer a shortage of medical doctors. It is understandable that after many years of studying for the medical profession, most doctors believe the recovery of the money spent is something they deserve. They therefore tend to look for a job in cities where they will be able to gain better working conditions in terms of money and career. Nevertheless, money should not be placed at the top of the reasons to practise this noble profession: the idea of being helpful to others or aiming to find, one day, a new cure for an old disease should be the real push to start this profession. Instead, based on what was highlighted above, as a consequence, in many rural areas, doctors seems to be a rarity. Mostly in little villages up in the mountains, the risk of having only one doctor to serve a very wide area is quite common nowadays. Logically, living in the mountains or in the countryside is less comfortable than in a city. With that said, to try and balance this situation, major fringe benefits should be foreseen in these areas in order to render these locations more appealing for the doctors. For instance, a house or car should be added as additional gifts, maybe a preferential lane for a faster career as well might be helpful. Doctors are really important in all our lives and we all should spend more time on thinking how to improve their working conditions in the pursuit of diminishing the risks of losing these professionals not only from the rural areas but also from the country itself.

Once upon a time humans knew how to sing. At that time humans did not have musical instruments, but remembered the melody of the songs. About two thousands years ago, human invented musical instruments to simulate the tone of voice. In my opinion, studying music should be required in all schools because of the reasons below: First, everyone needs to develop both physically and mentally. To develop physically, humans need to do activities such as running, walking, climbing, working, etc. but to develop mentally, humans need to study, including studying music. Second, studying music will help one understand the musical notes. Musical notes simulate different tone of voices and are divided into 14 different frequencies. Each person can rewrite his tone by himself and he can compose a song after studying music. Third, studying music will help to develop human's brains completely. It will help to study the social subjects such as literature, history, psychology, geography,etc. Fourth, studying music and singing will help strengthen throat muscles. It will help make his or her voice clearer.

Lots of people think that good school results are only granted if teachers do not change over the years; some others believe that a change of teachers over the years can be more beneficial. I would start by setting a time range as students have needs differentiated by age: pupils in primary school certainly need to have a reference point , one teacher to teach not only school subjects but also as a guide for their psychological growth. In secondary school, instead, in my opinion, students need a change, they need to experience different references. They will have to begin to face the alternative nuances that life could offer, and what a good opportunity it is to start at school, with a teacher for various subjects! At college, students are grown up already and they can start to enrich their culture. This is the stage where they have already started to broaden their life vision by embracing alternative viewpoints. More professors can be a wide source in this direction. I strongly believe that the richness of human beings is in the variety, in any respect! BH

Recently a number of high schools have required that volunteer work has to be a compulsory students' activity in order for them to graduate. I believe that this is a fair and important step for the students and their growth, emotionally and professionally speaking. This requirement can certainly help students to better understand the real world outside the school environment . To most of them, first of all, it might give the opportunity to really get in touch with other realities, sometimes very different from their families and their usual way of living. Secondly they can have a sample of the working world with all its duties and responsibilities. Besides they might well decide that it could be the job they would like to do in the future as a living. For example, they could volunteer in a kindergarten and then realize that taking care of the children is what they have always dreamt of. For the same reason, they could find out that helping old people in their daily routine might be what they want to do for a living. Although they are not paid for this kind of activity, I strongly believe that thanks to the volunteer work they will receive much more in terms of learning and formation. I would definitely recommend all students to work as a volunteer while studying in order to broaden their horizons and grow as a person and as citizen.

I like to choose moving away and living on my own while I am attending university because of some reasons: Firstly, I am already an adult man when I am a student at university, and I understand what is right to do. According to Vietnamese law, I have the right to do everything in my own right way. Secondly, I will become more confident when I live alone because I have to think what I should do, how to do it and I have to decide everything.

My name is Josh and I am writing to give a better approach to the no mobile phones new law. I heard on the news that the use of mobile phones will be banned in some public places, shops and restaurants. I think this approach is a little mad. I am positive that we can find another one. For example, in the restaurants there could be an unwritten rule to obey. The rule will be like "Whoever is on the phone, will pay the bill." In the public transport if you are on the phone and you are seated, you have to give the seat to somebody else. In the shop if you are on the phone, you have to give your place in the queue to somebody else. The use of phones cannot be banned because many people have many problems. Maybe they want to talk with their sick child or their sick mother or it's an emergency and they must call 911. I am also anxious to find out what the main reason for this law is. There must be something that got on the city's hall nerves. In the end I would like to say that in the future the city hall must be more careful with the new laws because lately, we all laugh about the new laws.

It is important to tell the truth but sometimes a lie is the correct choice. Let's be honest, you can't always tell the truth. In some cases many people prefer a lie and in many other cases a lie is mandatory. For example, if someone is dying and you did something wrong to them long time ago, it will not make the whole situation better if you tell him the truth. Another example will be something involving national security. If the government asks you to lie, you'd better do it. A lot of lies in our life could be accepted if they were told in the proper situations. Even in a family it is OK to lie. If it's something from your past and you know that will affect your relationship, you'd better lie if you are sure that no one could find out. Let's be honest, everybody prefers to have peace in their house. A truth can affect that because everyone could forgive but not everyone could forget. On the contrary we cannot make a lie our weapon. A lie is in some cases good but the truth must be told in all other cases. We can't do bad things because we have a lie to rely on. In the end, I would like to say that everyone should first try to tell the truth if they can.

Music at school? Music as a school subject or how to learn and play an instrument is compulsory in a few schools while in some others, students are not required to do so. I think that music should always be added as subject to learn in each school at any level being very important to the emotional growth of scholars and an alternative way of learning about history. Just to give an example, learning about the history of music may give the students the opportunity to know about a part of human evolution. If you name, for instance, the period of romanticism , studying Wagner could make them understand the vision of the intellectuals in the nineteenth century. In addition , learning how to play an instrument can definitely help the development of a manual intelligence as well as a sensitive one in most of the students. Although listening to music can be relaxing, learning how to play it might become a more effective tool to use when you need to get rid of stress. In my view, I wish to underline again the importance of studying music as a school subject at any degree as it will enrich the students' inner world then it will broaden their emotional horizon and in the end, it will add another way to communicate: Music is absolutely another language which can easily talk to heart and soul.

I do not know if learning foreign languages is important these days. In my mind, it depends on the situation. If you have no ambitions and you are a lazy person, this is not for you. But if you are curious about the world, learning foreign languages is very important. Especially if your native language is only spoken by people in your country, and if you want to travel, or have really nice and well-paid work. Speaking some foreign language gives you the opportunity to travel and live wherever you want. You can meet a lot of people, exchange experiences, make new friends, and maybe find the love of your life. Learning other languages opens your mind to new experiences. When you learn new languages you get to know a new culture, the culture of the people who speak this language. In summary, I can say that speaking more than one language is very important to have a better and more interesting life. Especially for me.

Why do I learn English? Because I need to know this language to get a better life. Learning English opens the way to a better life for me. I would like to get better work and every good and big enterprise is searching for candidates who speak English very well. These days, when most companies cooperate with enterprises around the world, English has become the international language. Everyone who is well educated must speak English. This my first reason. My second reason is I like travelling. I love visiting different countries and meeting new people. Without knowledge of English I could not travel as I wish. The only way will be a participation in a trip proposed by a big travel agency, where you share all your time with the other participants. In this way of travelling I cannot meet local people and learn about their culture and traditions. The third reason is I can make friends around the world and we stay in contact via the internet. Learning English gives me the opportunity to have a better life, a better job, make friends, travel, and have a lot of fun.

Here, l would like to thank all of the workers that are working on Write&Improve to let the whole world improve their writing. They are not very famous, but very important for the whole world. They are working for what? A new, free, and reliable app for students that have trouble with things like writing a book report, or for someone who doesn't know how to complete a good piece of writing. I really like it because it is pretty good to improve your writing. After all these days, this thing was finally going to be like a part of my life. I remember the time l got my first B1 writing task. It was truly a delightful sight, and my dad even took me out to buy a cup of chocolate milkshake to celebrate. Now, this system is really good. And l would recommend it to my whole class because the best part of it all, it is free. Plus, it is pretty reliable too. Although there are no real people behind the feedback to let us get an answer, the robot can do all of the work for us. You might ask, "Hey, why is a robot so reliable?" Well,the robot is smarter than us. So letting them do the work is much better.

According to my imagination, l think that in the future, we will have some kind of device that some random scientist invented to transport ourselves to anywhere we want. You just press a button or tell the device where you want to go, then you will be right at your destination. But that probably won't be necessary until the year 2400 has come. So now, let's just talk about the late 2100s. You can read the next paragraph to get more information. First, cars. Cars right now aren't such a big hit for human civilization. But in the future? Then it will be a whole different story. In fact, l can bet 5000 dollars that in the future cars will be equipped with radar GPS, TV, and a snack bar, just in case the passenger or driver is a bit hungry. The cars can be molded to be any shape, just like Transformers. And most of all, the engine can be on full power (which is 350 miles an hour) for 6-12 hours. Plus, there will be high - tech weapons in case of a attack, and it can be completely camouflaged to the car.

Personally I think that being an employee of an office without a " cubicle " is more effective because in a cubicle you can feel less moveable than in an open space because in an open space with other workers you could start a conversation more easily than being in a cubicle and I think it's more comfortable for the people because they won't feel as claustrophobic as in other places, I've seen many cubicles and they aren't like in movies or in films, they are pretty small because there are lots of them, I've visited the " claustrophobic " ones and the " open " space ones and I did some research, or well, a survey to know which type of workers work more efficiently and can have a more stable conversation, and what my results say is that the big space ones are more efficient than the other ones but I don't really know why, and they both can have a stable conversation but I think that seeing the person who you are talking to is better than needing to stand and look over the tiny walls that separate them.

Dear sir, I read an article in a newspaper that said that the town council is planning to ban using mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In my opinion, I think it is not a good idea because of some reasons below: First, today mobile phones are smart phones. People use smart phones for many purposes such as working, studying, communicating, etc. Many people do not finish their work before going home and they have to work on the way home. They have to use mobile phones to continue their work. I have applied for this job for 6 months and I have to study more to increase my knowledge and I often use my mobile phone to study the online course on the way going home. I have to save every minute. If the town council bans using mobile phones on public transport, how could I study any more? I know that many young people use their mobile phones to study their additional courses in free time. Second, online payment is developing very fast, many people use mobile phones to pay their bills when shopping. I know that our government encourages people to use electronic payment. it helps the economic system to be more transparent. If the town council bans using mobile phones in shops, people will have to use cash for their payment and the policy of using online payment from the government cannot be conducted. I am a responsible person and I find my responsibility for our country. I would like to recommend that the town council should not issue that ban.

A zoo is nothing more than an exhibition for people. Animals are kept in an environment as much alike as possible to the natural area that they would be living in, but this does not mean that they are living as they should be. It´s because they are living in a limited area, not surrounded by other animals or plants that would be their meal. All that they eat is easily given and they do not have to work to get it, so they easily become more domesticated. It´s not just because of this fact, but they are also more used to living around humans. All this make them become more distant from what an animal like that should be. No one likes being caged because it takes away the freedom that we are so willing to fight for. If we, humans, don´t enjoy it and we are more used to being enclosed in places like our homes, imagine what it would feel like for an animal that is used to living in an unlimited environment like the jungle. This drastic change could be devastating and could not just change their mood, but could also change their essence.

The development of technology has brought us lots of advantages, especially in the field of learning. Today, we are able to read articles, projects, and books from all over the world without leaving our seats. There is no doubt that this is a huge step in our existence, but we should also be aware that within this growth, there are some losses in the process. One of them is the possible replacement of books in the modern way of learning with tablets and computers. This new way could take from us the sensation of touching the book, the joy of turning its pages, and the pleasure of reading its last pages. The easy way of finding whatever you want online, which sometimes is even free, can also be a challenge for the survival of writers. This easier path, along with all of the distractions that are one click away, could be an obstacle for the absorption of content, especially for children and young readers. If this is a hurdle at home, it can be more difficult to control in schools and universities. The habit of going to a library and getting lost in thousands of books and having to work harder to find the right one can be stimulating and can also make the whole process more fun and more satisfactory.

Nowadays there are many problems in the rural areas, because most people are moving to the cities, and they are leaving the fields which give us our food. Because of that there is a lack of doctors in small villages, and this could be very dangerous. If an elderly person doesn't receive medical care at the right time, he or she could die early. First of all, we need doctors everywhere but many doctors don't want to be posted to small villages or towns. This is a problem and the reasons for this problem are uncountable. One main reason could be the money earned by them, it is said that in these areas the salaries are lower than the salaries of the big cities. Besides, if they are young they won't have many things to do and enjoy in these kinds of villages, although a doctor in a small town or village has a quiet and calm life, besides the charm of living in the field. Second, the solutions to these problems are very easy and very hard at the same time, because the main solution could be that the elderly move to big cities (however this is not going to happen, as all of us know), another solution could be to improve the work conditions of the doctors who work in small villages or give them prizes in order to boost their willingness to be posted to these areas. In conclusion, we have to take care of our rural areas and elderly people beside taking care of ourselves and as it is said in my village "an apple a day keeps the doctor away." This is my piece of advice today.

It is well known that day after day the requirements in studies are now more difficult than before and some high schools are asking for volunteer work in order to graduate. There is a lot of controversy about this fact in our society, because some people think that teenagers are too young to do this kind of work while the others have the opposite point of view. On the one hand, we have to say that hard work could teach and boost skills in teenagers, besides the fact that when they are doing this kind of activity they are far from dangerous zones, gangs and other harmful stuff, for instance in Spain there are some programs to teach about farming and these programs are done in the army bases around the country. The volunteer work that is done by teenagers could provide them with true knowledge which they could use in their real lives, for example when you work preparing food for poor people, this work gives you two benefits, one the cooking lessons and the other could be a different perspective of our society. On the other hand, we have to be careful about the situations that our teenagers are exposed to, for instance if they are not under the supervision of an adult they could have harmful relations with people that should receive the volunteer work, for example if they are working, some drug dealer could offer them drugs. To sum up taking both points of view into account, I strongly believe that the volunteer work produces a benefit for our society but it has to be done with adults and without stressing the students.

Since my dad was the president of the government, l am an expert in these things. But according to my dad's opinion, the future school will be decided by the students' president. Here's what l think it should be. First, a school's students will vote for a student president and the teachers will collect the votes to find out which student will be elected. When the student president has been elected, different student presidents from other schools will vote again to decide what the future school will look like. But let's get on topic. First, there will be no use for teachers or blackboards. Every class will be taught online with laptop computers. There will be no classrooms. The students would stay in their dorm to study and discuss questions either online or with the roommates that are in the same dorm. Kinda like when we were trying to get through the COVID-19 periods. The teachers will all be perfectly knowledgeable professors. Kind of what you will find in the Ivy League schools. And that's my opinion.

Books and technology Computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities because we can damage books and we will need to buy new ones, and it is very hard to find an exact copy of the book. If we had tablets or laptops, it would be easier to study. Our backs won't hurt anymore. If we damage or wet books, we need to buy new ones, but, if we have tablets or laptops, we won't break them because they are expensive and we like them. In twenty years, we won't have books, we will have tablets and laptops. But why should we have them in twenty years and not now? That is the big question. My opinion is to replace them now because studying will be more fun because we can watch videos about those things that we have in school. Technology is the future.

There has been a heated debate for many years on the availability of medical care in rural areas. Many doctors left these areas to provide medical in big cities. What is more, those who were old had retired. If this trend continues, the situation will not be sustainable. Furthermore, it might soon result in a phase that rural areas lose the ability to provide medical care to the same extent as it was before. To solve that problem, we have to deal with arguments that cause this lack of medical care. Let us unpack some of them. Lack of financial resources is one of them. A regular income provided to doctors in rural areas is not so efficient to cover all services linked to providing medical care. Secondly, another reason is the attractiveness of the location where we want to invest in medical care. Lack of infrastructure, for example. The infrastructure and transportation system plays an important role. If we take it seriously and tackle that problem successfully, we have to provide a proper background.

Banning the use of smartphones. We see accidents related to smartphones in the news every day and many people injured are kids. The city halls of many towns have the idea of banning the use of smartphone while pedestrians are walking. This is a way to stop this kind of accident and save many lives, but this idea was very controversial when it was launched. To begin with this idea, we can reduce the number of deaths in city centers. For instance, if you don't look both ways of the street while you are writing a message, a car could hit you. Maybe you won't die in this accident but you could spend months in the hospital. Secondly, we have the money idea, for example when there is an accident we use a lot of money repairing cars, sidewalks and urban furniture, besides the salaries of workers, doctors, policemen, firemen, etc. With this law we will be able to use the taxes for better things and not to repair streets. Last year we spent three million euros in my town because of car accidents. If we had not had many accidents we would have used the money for other issues. In contrast to this idea, some people could think that this idea could break people's freedom and they have their reasons, because this is a law that forbids the use of things that you bought, besides the next idea, you could think that the city hall only wants to save money, not protect our lives. To sum up, I strongly believe that if you want to send a message you can stop, write and send the message and go on your way. I support this idea and I hope that when we have this law we will reduce our deaths.

During the last 10 years, university students and school children have changed their way of playing and spending their spare time gaining new unhealthy habits. Younger generations have been starting to spend lesser time outside than the older ones, preferring to play computer games or simply watching television rather than thinking of a game to do outside such as playing hide-and-seek or playing football or, even simpler, just taking a short walk. Not playing often outside, spending instead most of the time sat on a chair or on a sofa, the bad result on their health has started to show heavily. In order to avoid worse consequences in their adult life, doctors and health experts would suggest forcing them to do any physical activity at least three times a week. I definitely agree with this suggestion. I believe that children, teenagers and young adults should be educated in a new culture for a healthier body by drawing their attention to the sports activities and besides this, I would add as well, the stress on a healthier diet would not do any harm. Whatever kind of physical or leisure activity which involves movements would fit perfectly with this new kind of education. Therefore not only taking a swimming course or a football training, but also taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going to school on foot or by bike instead of by bus or by car, could be a good start towards the right direction to improve the bad unhealthy habits. Parents should help their children in this task as they look at us as an example, always. However the frantic modern life can sometimes refrain us from taking a healthier behaviour because it could look more difficult. As long as we, as adults, do not change our static lifestyle, we will not be able to push our children to explore new healthier habits. If we wish to gift them with a healthy adult life, we will have to begin soon.

Student not only study socialism but also study morality. They need to develop not only knowledge but also physics. Some schools have a requirement that students have to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I think it is a good way for students study morality and it will help to develop the physic of students. Students have more opportunities to study real life and things. They will study what to do in team work and organize working. They will face difficulties when doing something, and they will find out the way to solve problems and how to cooperate with each other to do the work well. They have more social activities when doing volunteer work. The more activities they have, the more development of physic they will have. It is said that a child's right side of their brain will develop when his left side of body is moving and vice versa. We should encourage children to act and do as many things as possible.

I would like a long, calm life until 100 years old in order to enjoy my life. It is very important to take your time to discover all the good things in it. There is one expression: take your time, step by step, like the proverb, the rabbit and the turtle from Moliere. You can do everything, as much as a person who does things intensely, less fast for sure but you will get the opportunity to do all things much more deeply and with consciousness of the things surrounding you. That's why, this reflection is very important to have. Life is full of very nice and admirable things which are worth taking time to appreciate and not something we don't care about. We have only one life which deserves our attention and this is a very important thing to care about. Furthermore, with time you will get more knowledge of items surrounding you than you will do quickly because at this stage, the whole thing will be quick and you won't value it. You have to consider than sometimes this is not a choice in your life and perhaps you would rather enjoy this life than live it intensely. This is something very respectable as well. If you can take one example, people who have a shorter life and want to live deeply haven't got the choice to do it if they want to find it out. These are our own choices.

I don't know how to approach this subject. It is odd to ask a person if he wants to live long or intensely because everyone wants both. Regarding the answer I have to give, it depends on the type of life. I wouldn't like to live only 20 years and intensely but I also wouldn't like to live 100 years and to be like a robot. The way I see it, a good life is one lived with balance. I see myself living intensely, not like a robot, but also not like a moron. To give an example: I would definitely go to parties but not to get in a coma from alcohol. This word "intense" has to have it's own boundaries. We have to live intensely with responsibility. I also don't see myself in the other extreme. I have friends who don't like to fly because they are scared of airplanes, but we both know that it is safer in the air. I am a man who likes to put balance in everything, especially in life. I don't like to be extreme, even if it's to the left or the right side of the boundary. We all have to live an intense life but with responsibility and in this way we'll live a long and intense life and we will achieve everything we propose.

Nowadays, people are not doing exercise owing to their long working hours. Due to an inactive life this will lead to some health problems in the future. For young people some foundations such as universities or schools may help students to avoid an inactive lifestyle. Initially, they can force a sport activity on students to get them into a habit. First of all, educational foundations can show many paths for students to be healthy. Universities can help children to be active with antrenors, dieticians and teachers who are professionals in the field of sports. Nevertheless, students will learn to manage their time thanks to an active life. If universities forced students to do activities at least three times per week, students' psychological lives would be more regular for them. It is a well-known fact that exercise helps people who have depression or any psychological disease. On the other hand, students have not managed their time owing to heavy work. Universities want students to use their time efficiently. Furthermore, if students do exercise properly, they can be motivated substantially when they do other hard work. This way which is applied by the schools is not force in fact. It just provides as healthy life. Some people think that universities or schools cannot force students to do exercise. Their idea is wrong I think because universities do not earn money from students with this path. They think this idea is wrong in terms of economic income. Even if they think it is wrong, no doubt exercise helps students in many aspects. To sum up, it is a well known the fact that exercise helps everyone for a healthy life. Thereby, universities should force students to do exercise three times per week. Thanks to this path students get used to doing sports in their life.

Studying at university is an important choice in life and as a consequence, in relation to the chosen school, it is sometimes necessary to move from home. Some students decide then to leave home and stay on their own while some others choose to stay with their families. The first decisive factor, establishing whether to stay with parents while studying at the university or to leave home, is the economic aspect which most of the time determines as well the choice of the university to attend. In my opinion, I would suggest staying home with parents so that students could totally dedicate their time to studying instead of trying to balance school and a job. Thinking just about the school may help to get over the university in due time and obviously by respecting the timetable, it results in an additional cost saving. On the other hand, if students decide to leave home and live by themselves while studying, they have first of all to consider the additional cost of a rented apartment. They need then to start thinking of their life as an adult one with all its consequences. For example, they definitely need to look after their new house, think about how to arrange their daily routine such as shopping for meals or cleaning the house. All these actions take time from their studies. In addition, should they need to look for a job to gain a living, they will have less time for school. In some cases, this situation can lead the students to withdraw from university. In the end, I strongly believe that the best and the most effective way to study at university is to choose a school not very far from your parents' home in order to stay with your parents and dedicate all your energy towards the successful conclusion of the school career.

I would like to share with you the best tool that I have been using in the whole of my life to practise writing in English. One day I was talking with my English teacher about the difficulties that I have when I'm trying to study English alone and the main problem that I have is the difficulty in knowing if what I'm writing is correct or incorrect. The teacher told me about a good tool to verify my essays online, he said, it was developed by Cambridge University experts and it is similar to the corrections that I do in your essays. In the beginning I did not believe that it was possible, but I accessed the site and after I did my first essay I understand that it is true and an unbelievable tool, theartificial intelligence is amazing and it can make good suggestions to you improve your English words. I really love the suggestions that IA makes , sometimes I think that is difficult to understand where the mistakes are, because they don't provide details about what is wrong in my phrase, so you need to look at carefully to discover the problem. After a few days of using the site, I'm sure you will understand how artificial intelligence works and consequently will greatly improve your writing and expand your vocabulary.

One of the most difficult choices in life is related to the profession that we want to follow until we die. That´s a thought a little harsh to seek and to believe in as well, but unfortunately it is a common belief among adolescents and young adults. The entire journey needed to make that ultimate choice shouldn´t be dealt with with so much severity. We are not supposed to stick to that decision if we find out along the way that it is not our calling. That decision is susceptible to changes. The schools and all the professionals inserted in this world don´t offer the students the correct tools needed to make such an important decision like psychological assistance and a certain transparency of all the obstacles that they will face throughout the construction of their professional lives. The problems are even beyond these flaws in the educational system. Nowadays, teenagers don´t have enough patience to pursue greatness, because to achieve that level of success takes a lot of effort, commitment and a certain resilience when nothing is working out. There is also the error of judgement that greatness and success should come along with mountains of money and recognition. They don´t realize that greatness and success are a state of mind and spirit and they should breed happiness and well-being. When they are looking for success and a faster way to earn money, they all think that there is one way to accomplish it, that is being a doctor. The unhappy reality is that they are right. Medical doctors who have just graduated earn more money than any other professional. This eager search for richness becomes their main purpose on their professional lives and they forget about the ultimate vow that they made at their graduation. They should assist and provide medical care for those places where it is needed and to whoever is claiming for help. They shouldn´t be moved by greed, but by humanitarianism and sympathy. This is a current issue that just can´t be fixed rapidly, it takes a lot of commitment and planning mostly by the government and the educational system. Sadly, one of the main reasons that made them choose to become doctors may be the solution for this hurdle. The government should offer more money to those who apply for work in rural areas and other regions that lack medical assistance until the educational system shows results from their improvements.

An environment that provides comfort and silence is almost always the perfect place for any worker in a work place. When you give privacy to an employee, he feels comfortable, calm, relaxed and safe. Those characteristics remind him of a safe place and because of that, he will be more open and free to be himself out of the looks, pressure and critical expressions and words of his co-workers. This private area will relax him enough to induce his creativity and productivity. The results of an enclosed workstation will appear in the quality of the work presented by the employees and also in the number and agility of the tasks done by them daily. On the other hand, those offices with open design don´t have walls that can provide privacy for the employees. The privacy that comes with the walls offers a distance from the pressure caused by critical looks from co-workers and also offers a certain sound barrier between them. The lack of sound barrier is probably one of the main reasons why workers get so distracted during their daily work. When you are in an environment where you don´t feel comfortable enough to do your job, it can be quite challenging to achieve your level of concentration to start a task. When you finally got back on track, someone starts talking on the phone or with someone near you. That action disturbs anyone, even the most focused person and you will have a hard time trying to keep going with your work. Even more, when those conversations are over, you will spend another few minutes to get back to the rhythm and the level of concentration that you were at before you were interrupted. Those precious minutes stolen from your day due to the loss of focus, will certainly affect not just your productivity and quality, but also the entire office.

Now just let me get this straight. l was in my own seat and enjoying Judy Blume's music when three men wearing black and holding a gun in their hands ran inside and yelled: "Freeze! Or l'll shoot!" Everyone turned around and no one dared to move a muscle. Even Judy Blume stopped playing. We were like a herd of deer caught in a headlight. After one minute, a man ran out of the back door and escaped. I was the second one to go, l had to be sneaky to make sure l didn't make a big racket. When l finally escaped, l went straight to the S. W. A. T. office. They took those guys to the Supreme Court, and nobody was badly hurt. Except that woman who had been shot in the breast. Anyway, it was a traumatizing experience for sure. In fact, l was still trembling in my bed when l was sending you this letter. Moby

In every corner of the world, there is someone who knows a talented person who could have been an incredible professional if he was given the opportunity to develop this gift. It is known that it´s never too late to accomplish great things, but in some areas this truth is not applied, like in the world of the sports. Even though some people take that statement as a mantra in their lives, others think that those words belong only to a fairy tale world. These ones don´t think that the option to dive in to a new profession and leave behind years of commitment and dedication to their current profession is a valid one. I can´t blame them because the unknown can be really terrifying and this fear may be bigger than the wish to feel connected to their inner truth. Sometimes when a talent is discovered later in life, it can be more a curse than a gift because this person will be suffering from all that he could have done with it. He will regret it, will find someone to blame and maybe will feel bitter for the rest of his life. We often waste thousands of talents because we don´t offer the opportunity to each one of them to find out their calling. One solution to this error could be corrected through programs at schools. Schools need to offer to the students diverse programs of dance, sports, music and other areas so that they can choose themselves to which one they are more connected and comfortable with doing. Those programs should be a part of their educational system as an obligatory subject. At that age, adolescents and children have to be sometimes encouraged to make a move because science already confirmed that the part of our brain related to making decisions is not fully developed until 18 years old. That being said, all students should experience all kinds of classes like music classes. If they found out during those periods that they don´t have the talent or they don´t want to pursue it in their lives, they can bring this new ability to their daily lives as a hobby. Music is always welcomed in anyone´s lives. Music can give us peace of mind, change our mood, increase our concentration and help us to overcome and release a feeling that has been harming us and jeopardizing our growth. Everybody should have the opportunity to know how to play an instrument or how to sing and the best period to introduce it is at school.

My reasons for learning English To make a long story short, l will place my reasons in two different paragraphs. First, l'm Chinese, which means l'm foreign. lf l can learn the English language very well, l can get respect from my fellow students. Both in my own home in China or in America. l can make a living by just being a professor in a college teaching business English. Second, almost 2/3 of the people in the world speak English . So l can have lots of friends by just using one language. The third reason, however, is a little like the disadvantage of studying English. The only problem is that l'm afraid of if my English was So I'd better just do a bit at a time. And here l'm not only talking about me, l'm talking about all of the guys and gals who study English. If you really want to study English, l recommend you become a student teacher to see how you can teach.

It's more important to be healthy than to be rich. I follow and respect this statement, but there is a catch. How can you be healthy when you are poor? Like, if your family has no money, then how do you keep yourself healthy? You'd starve to death. Or, if you sit on the road, begging others to throw money into your cup, you'd be very weak because of the diseases lying around the street. So if you are poor but healthy you still will be weak. That's why when Barack Obama got to be president, he had a program called Obamacare. It's for if a person gets involved in a terrible accident and the person is badly hurt, the medical expenses will be mostly paid by the government if it's difficult to pay at once. But let's look at the different side. If you are very wealthy but not healthy, you can still recover by eating pills and resting. After all, money can particularly buy anything, except money, people, and time. So the statement "It is more important to be healthy than to be rich" is partly not true.

First, l have to point out that l have no hard feelings or animosity towards HUAWAI, MIX, Oppo, and Vivo (ICYMI, these are all big electronics companies). But my theory is that electronics can never replace something in the educational board. Or at least, not completely. If you ask me, 'Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities?' , my answer is that it depends on how you use them. l mean, it is possible that computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities as long as everyone knows how to use them properly. You open your iPhone, and instead of studying, you play a game. Then in this case, computers and tablets absolutely can't replace books in schools and universities. But if you open your hybrid school website, and you study very hard on it, then computers and tablets can completely replace books in schools and universities. So it really depends on who you are and what you are going to do on the electronic device.

Dear town council, I am writing this letter because 15 families from Star Street have chosen me to be a delegate. This letter articulates all Star Street's villagers' emotions, feelings and thoughts. I have been living in this town for 70 years. I was born in this town. Me and my family's daily routines were very difficult when I was a child. There were no technological devices, machines for farming and communication devices but that was 65 years ago. I and many of the town members wished to have some technology. There were different members in the town councils in those years. One day they asked us if we wanted to have telephones. Then they said they would get the substructure ready for telephone lines. On that day we got used to using mobile phones everywhere. We all have been very thankful to the old town council because mobile phones made a very big change in our lives. We all had been using our mobile phones happily before this bad idea was clarified by the town council. Many of us have children, relatives and grandchildren who live in city centers; we want to communicate with them easily everywhere. We like our town's development. We all agree that we have a right to make phone calls, send messages, to put it simply, use a mobile phone. We don't want you to introduce that kind of law in our town. Best regards, Eva Sparks and The Star Street Villagers.

Nowadays telling or not telling lies is being used as if they were the same thing by actually teenagers who represent our future. If we take a look at history, there have always been people who tell lies. Even children's fairy tales had villains who tell lies. But in today's modern world the number of people who can tell lies has increased. In my opinion in the future lies will be being told by people because there can be situations which are dangerous and vital. For me in that kind of situation it is acceptable to tell lies which do not affect other people's life. I want to give an example in my life. When I was I child I used to be a naughty student in the class. One day I had an argument with my classmate. I had started saying bad words to my classmate before she did the same thing to me. After hours I came home, my mother asked me if I was guilty in that argument and I lied to her. The day after my mother learned the truth and she felt very bad. On that day I understood that in the world there are very precious things. When we tell lies, those things are dying. If I hadn't told that lie on that day I would tell lies nowadays. In conclusion, we should be honest. Everyone needs to understand the importance of honesty.

Hi Penfriend, I was thinking, and l thought l should recommend you some entertainment. So I picked this film out for you. It's called Fire Anger. This movie has blood, knives, and guns. The main story revolves around a policeman that catches a baddie and deals with the bloody consequences. I'm not going to give you any more information or you won't have any interest in watching it. By the way, this is my favorite movie. I think you should watch it because by using only 24 - 69 main characters, they perfectly interpret the absolute battle between the world gray, black, and white's war. Of course, the evil villains always lose, but not in this movie. In this movie, the director lets us take a tour of the world where the world that the black is the absolute ruler of the world. Like living in the holocaust all day. Anyway, be sure to watch that film! I will wait for your reply in a week. Best wishes, Gregory

Well, this is not a simple question, I don't like noise, and currently like sleeping in a dark and quiet place, I don't need to sleep more than ten hours daily, but need to sleep eight hours every day. If I don't sleep at least eight hours, I have no energy the next day. But it is not a rule for me, when I go camping, I frequently sleep less than eight hours, because I am in a different situation. In these cases, I usually sleep in a tent, and in this place there is less darkness and more noise.

Nowadays, some people have a bad habit of using the mobile phone, what is not true is the mobile phone is bad for human beings, many officers can use it to work online, and get information about what happens around us, what's more, we can also invest in stocks, and students can use it to study online. So, personally speaking, I can't agree with this idea. First and foremost, a mobile phone benefits us. We can use it to contact our parents, and play games to unwind ourselves. I know there are many debates about how the mobile phone should be banned. My opinion is absolutely not. As I said, a mobile phone benefits us, but try to us, but try to transpositional consideration, you may discover that people can't can't leave the mobile phone anymore. If the mobile phone was banned in public areas, individuals couldn't ring others, or get some information in time, and time also becomes difficult to control. Additionally, mobile phones may do harm some people, they decrease the relationship between the family, and make people become estranged from each other. However, it is not the mobile phone's fault, but the way of using them, and I think the town council should lead people to use them in a correct way, but not ban them in public areas. This method will sharpen contradictions, and make the situation worse, or even destabilize society. All in all, as the saying goes, we should be channeling, not blocking, we should lead the citizens to the right way to use them, and I believe the mobile phone, the crystallization of science and technology, can modify the society more wonderful.

This tool is very important to improve my skills in writing. Online feedback is the best practice to fix the flaws in the texts. Things that I liked: online feedback, short tasks, small problems to solve, progress analysis, levels to pass, and also it being an online tool is very important too. Things I didn't like: I'm missing a graph showing the complete evolution of all the exercises, because I can only see the last ten ranked. One difference of this tool is the intuitive design, it's very simply to use and comfortable to write with. Another feature that can improve our skills in writing texts is maybe an online dictionary, this feature would make writing much easier. Other characteristics of this tool are that it is easy to find in an online search, I found this tool in a simple search on Google, and the free option to exercise my writing, which is the factor that caught my attention. If it were possible, I would recommend this tool to every student that needs to improve their skills in the English language. I am just at the beginning of learning but yet see the importance of this.

My favourite indoor activity is ping pong, it's easy to play and needs little space, with two players you can play a match and have fun moments. I like ping pong because it has less rules than other sports, and we can play at any moment, you have no special skills to play and it's simple to explain to a new player. The last time I played ping pong was when I was in France, in January of 2020. I will invite you to play a match.

I started to do ten minutes of daily exercise during the week, and progress to more minutes week by week, now I do about 20 minutes of daily exercise.

Nowadays, the internet and the way of life at home contribute to an inactive lifestyle. Citizens can, without stepping out the door, get a takeaway and all of the things that life needs, so somebody came up with an idea that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports at least 3 times per week. As far as I'm concerned, I can't agree with this idea. It is good to promote national exercise, but it should not be forced but should be channelled. First and foremost, people of all ages have something they must do, like students: they have to prepare for the term's final exam, and the freshmen need to study hard to get credits, and the graduates may have to prepare for an interview and work hard and steadily so they can't do sports, so it will intensify many contradictions in society. Moreover, it may cause trouble for a lot of people. Additionally, there are variety of approaches to deal with the national inactive lifestyle phenomenon but it is not the only way to force students and children to work out at least 3 times every week. For example, the government can hold some citizens' games, or shoot some promotional video to encourage individuals to work out frequently, which can benefit them a lot. All these ways are better than forcing them to do sports. What's more, teenagers and children may have a rebel mentality, and I am convinced that if the government wants to implement some policies, some punitive measures are bound to be enacted, In that case, some families don't want their children to be punished, so they will force them to do sports which teenagers and children don't want to do, so the gaps in relationships will appear, which will lead to a truancy rate surge, and finally cause a suicide rate increase. All in all, I know it is critical to improve national physical fitness, and let the young love the feeling of going outside and not sit in modern buildings all day, but maybe some better options could be chosen.

Since the first human settlements, music has been part of our lives. Archaeological evidence has shown different types of musical instruments of each culture discovered until now. These cultures created their own music and instruments to play it. Music looks to be an essential manifestation in human life. Music has been important in human groups as a demonstration of identity and support, like national anthems, songs to celebrate battles, to remember ancestors, and to celebrate new births. Further, music has accompanied historical events around the world and now it has become a support to new social claims and movements too. The reason why music is part of human life is because it makes us feel sensations with more intensity. Each human emotion is boosted with music, one kind of music makes us feel powerful, another makes us feel happy, another makes us feel sad, and another makes us feel proud. Even though there are some types of music which make us feel all these emotions with a single song. Thus, music is a loyal partner in our lives, it is magic which enters by our ears, it is transformed and comes out like corporal movements and sensations. Without music human life would be boring and gray.

We need music in our lives. Seriously, l can't believe why you can even call a life without BGM a life. Here's why l think so. First, we need to listen to songs without music and compare them to regular songs with BGM: a totally big difference. When you are listening to a song without BGM, you're not listening to a song anymore, you are listening to some random people particularly reading these song lyrics to you. Most importantly, music can help us relax. Like when you have a hard day, you can put on any music you like when you are in the shower to get your muscles to slow down and take a break. If the stuff l said before did not persuade you into believing that music is important, good. If yes, even better. Because just imagine what the world would be like without bands and CDs. The happy birthday song will just be some lyrics. The parties will be just a cool set up with refreshments and games. No fun. Plus, music restaurants will lose their business just because music doesn't exist anymore.

Yes, we need music in our lives because it relaxes us. Music is not just for fun, it is used for changing our mood. When we listen to a song something happens in our brain that makes us happier. Sometimes we are studying with focus and listening to music at the same time, sometimes we need silence and turn off the music to be able to focus on something. Music is important to us, like water or food, it is essential and today more and more people are listening to music when doing daily activities. Without music our life would have less joy. We like music because we feel better when we hear a rhythm. Although something opposite happens when other people listen to their music at a volume that we can hear. In these cases we have the opposite feeling, we are annoyed because we don't like to hear the music that other people like. There are many styles of music around the world, and there are times when one rhythm is better than the others because we have different feelings throughout the day.

Music plays a key part in our lives, I think. The same as a fish without water. and look at the importance of music in our life. Imagine music as a powerful tool that can change our mood in a positive or even negative way. To give an illustration, when you listen to music you do not love too much, it makes you feel angry. Conversely, you can listen to music that makes you feel happy. However, there is also a state of mind in which we need a pause. Let us say it differently, your mind got to a point where music can cause negative feelings and what you need is silence. By and large, music has a disruptive effect on our brains. Finally, I cannot imagine my life without music. Music helps me overcome difficulties, change my attitude, think better about something, and I could continue... Music keeps me above water with most things.

For me music is not important, it is fundamental! I can't live without it! I listen to music all day and every day. Music is culture. Each time period and every historical event had their soundtrack. Just think of Bob Dylan and the American revolution, or also Guthrie and the Vietnam war, for example. Another one is Pink Floyd and the Berlin wall. And every nation has its own kind of music! It is fantastic! Music is also entertainment, concerts, and disco, for example. Another thing is that music is for relaxing too. And we can't forget music therapy. But music is also natural noises, like wind, rain, the waves on the sea, and animal sounds. Can we imagine a world without music? Or a film without a soundtrack? I think the answer is no! Music is a kind of magic in our life.

The best season of the year. Having a favourite season of the year is not a rule for everyone. Sometimes people prefer winter, sometimes those same people prefer summer or spring, and the reason is not easy to understand. Summer is my favourite season, but I like winter or spring the same way, it depends on my mood in the year and depends on the conditions I'm in in a specific year. We as humans like the sun and clear days with few clouds, this kind of day makes us happier than other days. Winter has more cloudy days and is grayer than other seasons. On these days, people's mood changes to melancholy and some people are less happy than on other days. It depends on the moment the person is going through and the activity they need to do that day. The seasons are inevitable, my recommendation is to relax and enjoy every moment, you will adapt and see the beauty of the seasons more, the older you get.

Every professional around the world would like to get a good job. Getting a job with a great salary, with enough equipment to work with and with options to learn more to do his job the best. This is a reasonable desire because each professional invested a lot of time and money in his academic training. However, all these professionals forget the first reason to train in a particular career, which is to solve problems, help and support actions to improve human lives. This reason is remarkable in health careers like medicine and nursing. Unfortunately, selfishness is increasing nowadays and searching for a good and comfortable life as well as possible is more important than other professional aims. Further, governments don't promote medical doctors contributing with medical services for these people. Governments don't want to offer doctors good salaries or safe places to work. So, even though a few medical doctors want to help these people, they are not able to do it because they don't have access to basics supplies and conditions to do their work.

For some people it may not be complete rocket science however some may wrap their head around this question I'm about to present. Would you rather live a long calm life or would you prefer a short but intense life instead? Let's dive into that... On one hand, we have a long peaceful life, which I bet many introverts would, according to studies, choose over a chaotic intense life. Life full of happiness, friends or even family. Sounds like a dream come true, doesn't it? Have you ever wondered though what you'd do with this long period of time in your hands? Your life might get boring after a while not doing anything exciting. On the other hand, however we have a short yet more intense life full of adventure, memories and good laughs. This option sounds more appealing to outgoing and sociable people. There are cons to this option for certain and it's up to every single one what seems more likeable to them. I, personally, would without a doubt choose the second option: having a shorter yet more intense life. I'm aware nobody specified the exact period of time I'd get to live, nonetheless picturing myself sitting on sofa maybe reading a book for perhaps 60 years seems like a waste of my time, whereas adventures, even small ones for instance, simply appeal as more exciting and I desire a life where I can turn back to see what I happened to achieve or simply look back with a smile on my face knowing I have done everything I'd wished for.

Last week I went to a music concert. I know it is unusual for me, but I went because I needed to have new experiences and meet new people. A master soprano sang at the music concert and he had a wonderful voice. I didn't know that people can sing for two hours without a break. I went back home and slept remembering the lyrics of the song. I will go again if he comes back to town, and I would like you to come with me to appreciate the show. What do you think about it? Could you go with me?

Yes, computers and tablets can replace books in schools and universities because they are easier to use than books. The problem is not using a book to learn something, it's the time it takes to find an answer, much longer than necessary. Children currently use smartphones, computers, and tablets from the first days of life. Usually a baby comes into contact with a screen in the first month of life. Children grow up knowing how to use a digital tool to find something or solve problems. The answer to everything is on the internet, we need little time to find what we need. So why do we need to spend a lot more time looking for something in a book? With a tablet in our hand we have access to many books, we have a library in hand. We can change the book we are reading by closing it and opening another in two clicks. Despite the advantages, a book has charm, some people like to have a book in their hands, see the book in their physical libraries, or read something on the pages instead of on screens.

Yes, learning a foreign language is important today because the world is more connected than ever before. Nowadays, people talk to others who are in different places around the world, and they feel comfortable doing so. English is the most-used language to communicate with other people when you are in a foreign country, but Chinese will be used more and more in the future. If you work for a global company, you need to learn English. Knowing a foreign language is essential to get a job in a multinational corporation. In the past, the internet was not well developed, we had fewer tools to communicate with other people, and we basically used cell phones to talk long-distance. Our parents worked in local companies so they didn't need to speak another language, but the reality has changed and today everyone needs to know a foreign language to work. I think that in the future, learning a language will be easier, with the advent of new tools we will learn English more easily than in the past.

Television entertains, but can it also educate? The answer to this question is no. Today, television programs are not used for educational purposes. Broadcasters need an audience, and to achieve their goals they broadcast all kinds of content without bothering to show important things. We have more options today than in the past, with the advent of the internet we can choose what we see. We don't have time to sit in front of a TV to watch something that is always interrupted by advertisements for products we don't need. If I need to watch some entertainment, I'll open a streaming tool like Netflix, Amazon, Disney, HBO, or similar. I don't have to wait to see something I'd like to see, I just look for the entertainment I want to see instantly. If I need to learn something, I'll look for the information on the internet. Fewer people are watching television and this number will continue to drop. I think in the future we will be to have cable TV packages with a flexible set of channels that we choose ourselves. Do you think I'll be right about these predictions?

The school of the future will be better than it was in the past, with internet access to information increasing impressively. I think schools will be different in many aspects. The learning process will be enhanced with many digital technologies, like virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms. Although these technologies are better than the current ones, I think that some things will possibly not change, such as dependence on a professor, the contact with other children, a school environment that favors interaction, and different levels to reach knowledge gradually. Perhaps education will be tailored to the particular needs of students, leading them to reach their greatest individual potential. The present structure of education imposes the same form of education on all children, and this is not the best practice to train smart people, it just prepares the children to solve the same problems and get them into low-paying jobs. We need to change the format of the schools to improve the education of society so that we can compare ourselves with people from developed countries. The power is in our hands!

In my opinion, music is awesome. I listen to music to do almost everything in my life, like running, cleaning the house, or working. In my case, music makes me feel happy and strong to struggle with my life. I don't know how I would survive without music. One of my favorite things to do is go out to the pub and listen to music and drink beer. I have watched rock concerts since I was young. I like almost all kinds of music, but my favorites are rock, electronic, and MPB. In 2019, I went to Tomorrowland, which is one of the most famous electronic festivals in the world. It is located in Belgium and happens only on the weekend. In Tomorrowland it is possible to know people from every country in the world, all of them are looking for relaxation, enjoying the music, and sometimes getting a date. It was my first experience of a big festival and I can say that it was gorgeous, I felt the flow of the music and the energy of the place in my heart and my mind. I suggest everybody that likes music go to a place like this to know exactly how much you like music and people. For me it was very good because I love music.

Dear John, How are you? I hope you are in good health. As for me, I am fine and all the others in my family are fine too. How did you spend your last holidays? As for me, I cleaned my room and then watched a movie. It was about a family who moved to a new house. The name is Totoro and it is one of the most famous movies of Studio Ghibli. The reason why I like this movie was that when difficulties came, they faced them together and tried to solve them together. It was so much fun and the storyline was so lovely. So, I think you should watch this movie too.,. Anna

I think that using computers and tablets in schools and universities has both advantages and disadvantages. Nowadays, the world is becoming more up to date than it was in the past, especially, with students using computers as a learning tool. One of the advantages of using computers is that the students don't need to carry a heavy backpack anymore. They can go to school happily. The next one is that because the students use computers and tablets in schools, they are keeping in touch with technology from when they are young. So, I think that there will be no problems with technology in the workplace. But there are some disadvantages of using computers and tablets in schools. Some of the students have eye diseases because of using computers. And computers and tablets are expensive nowadays, so some students can't effort to buy them. In conclusion, although there are some disadvantages in that statement, I still believe that using computers and tablets in schools and universities is an essential thing for students.

As you know arrangement of your office at the workplace you work in plays an important role. Moreover, it also has an impact on your feelings and communication with your colleagues and mind. In the first group, you can find workers who prefer to be in closed and separated areas equipped with no special furniture. However, they make a lot of effort to arrange their offices in a simple way but in the spirit of the latest design and modern furniture to feel much more comfortable. To be more precise, they prefer their offices with daylight from the outside through the windows. From the above, we can understand that those people have a weakness for presenting well-being. They also like small and well-organized places where all things have their own place. In addition, they must visually present their success in the way to show their awards and diplomas on the walls of their offices. The other group of workers tend to have simply arranged offices with no special design. Those offices usually have a purposeful arrangement. By and large, a simply arranged office dominates. Notably, places for others who come in to discuss a problem or even participate in a meeting are not missing. Conversely, those places in which workers spend at least eight hours per day would be comfortable. For example, their workplaces are equipped with places where people can meet and have a short break for discussion. In my view, the second example of an arranged office seems to be the most persuasive. To clarify my opinion, I am a person who loves to be surrounded by positive and communicative people sharing their ideas. If someone asks me what I would suggest having in my office, I would say nothing special – in a roundabout kind of way. Last but not least, the more effort you put into the design of your office the more comfortable you will feel there.

These days we are witnessing heated debates about students' volunteer work. Students in high schools had to make their commitments to undertake a certain amount of hours of volunteer work to graduate. To be more precise, they were given a chance to choose one from the school’s offer. There were counted around 100 volunteer work positions available. However, many of them had to turn a blind eye to this requirement and say it is not by school standards. There are two sides of the coin. On one hand, it is obvious that in some countries we can find schools aimed at practical use. To give an illustration, plant growing and other manual work needed to be practised, in fact, to receive a certificate of qualification. As a final stage of your education, you will be asked to undertake a test or an exam to show your gained knowledge at a certain level. On the other hand, some schools are not aimed at education including manual or similar work. Those students are prepared for a high level of education or in management or leading positions within an organization. For example, in the financial sector or they even work in the field of education. If I look at both sides, I have to admit my disagreement with the implementation of volunteer work in schools. Students should not be forced to earn money for their education. In my view, the responsibility to educate each generation of students is on the government. What I am trying to say is that parents of children should not pay for their education. If we want to have a growing economy in the future, we have to invest and participate more in developing our pillar of education. If I had a chance to make a change, I would have given more money from the government budget to the education sector. Another key thing to remember is to reduce and replace old methods of learning by using new technology.

Many would say that an intense brief existence could be harsh to choose if they were given the opportunity to decide how to live their life, but not for me, because I would definitely opt for it. I would take the chance to go back in time, rewind my 'life tape' and restart from the beginning to live each and every single moment as if it were the last. I am thrilled by the etymology of the lemma 'life', a concept bound to energy, an essence that all human beings have inherited and can reproduce in many different forms. Energy generates life, in a circle that is timeless and infinite. From an holistic point of view I see a short lifespan as a flood of experiences and events, a concentration of feelings and emotions which most of the historical figures like poets, writers, scientists have lived. I would have loved to be like them and I would prefer leaving a trace and make my life an exciting trip. In fact, it makes me wonder that I would exciting to experience as much as I could, in order to make my life worth of living. My still young life has taught me that deep feelings bring inevitably struggle, pain, disappointment, uncertainties and agony, but life should not be as beautiful as it is without them. There is a need to know that the bright side of a thriving life comes next, when we disappear, and the memory of what we did will live forever. I live mine in the same way, as a rush of feelings, even though I don't know how long it will last.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich. This statement could be applied to some people, but is not a rule for everyone. Sometimes being healthy is not a guarantee for a happy life, being healthy without enough money to supply basic needs is not a desirable life. On the other hand, being rich without health is not enjoyable, the most important thing is the balance between both things. People need enough money to survive with the minimal comfort and be healthy enough to live without restrictions. Some people work hard to save money during their entire life and spend this money trying to solve health problems that they created while trying to save more money. Being healthy or being rich is a sensitive issue, some people prefer one and others prefer the other. We need to understand what is most important to us and not make value judgments about the decision of others. If a person is happy being healthy without money or being happy with lots of money without health, no problem, this is a private choice.

Travelling is one thing that makes people feel better in their lives, not only to share experiences with friends, but to improve their own life experience. When we discover a new culture and visit new places our universe expands and we know that our daily work makes sense. In my opinion, the future of travel will not be much different from the present situation, maybe some things will be different like transportation or things like that, but the travelling itself or the desire to travel will not change. The need for travelling might still be the same, people need to travel, it is a habit installed in all humans, and this will not change. One thing I think will be different in the future, is the places that people will go to, some places on the earth will be changed by global warming, and some people will choose other places to avoid problems with the climate. Another thing I think will be different, is the improvement of digital solutions for travelers, like automatic translators that will enable every person to communicate with others without the language barrier. Who knows what the future holds?

Exercise is important to our health, but are there things that are more important? I think not. Without health we cannot do anything, we depend on our bodies to do everything in our lives. If we don't take care of our health, who will do it for us? Exercise is not a pleasant activity, but it is necessary, we need to exercise thirty minutes a day to be healthier. It doesn't take longer than that time to make our bodies better than those of people who don't exercise. A sedentary lifestyle is a modern problem that causes many problems in society. Many health problems can be solved with daily exercise. Some people argue that they have no time to exercise, but it is not true, if you analyse the routine of these people, you will find time to practise some exercises. Exercise is not a question of time, it is a matter of wanting to. If you want, you will find time to exercise. Money is important, but without health you won't be able to use the money you save. Think about that, and change your life style. The power to change your life is in your hands, use it and enjoy the path.

This year, I want to learn English at an advanced level, I will be pleased if by the end of the year I have developed the necessary skills to talk with other people without mistakes.

The best holiday I ever had was Christmas of 2018. I was in Uruguay on this holiday on a road trip. We had arrived in Montevideo on holiday when we realized that there was nothing open, we didn't have anywhere to have lunch or to buy food or meals. This was no problem, as my wife and I were able to walk around the city without traffic. We saw many beautiful places and in the evening, we ate bread with turkey pate because there were no restaurants open. It was the best holiday I ever had because there were no people in the streets, we could walk alone in the city, and drive on empty roads, we could move through the streets as fast as possible, and we got to know the whole city in one day. We did our whole tourist itinerary that we had planned to do in a few days, so we could go to another city on the same road trip. We went to Buenos Aires in Argentina. It was a really good holiday and we enjoyed every moment of that day.

Some people believe that it is good for students to have the same teacher for several years. Others think that students benefit more from new teachers each year. I think both options are good. When students have the same teacher for several years, they will understand the model of teaching that the teacher has and will adapt themselves to focus more on classes than on things like the uncertainty about which teacher they will have in the next class. Nonetheless, having different teachers is good too. When students have new teachers every year, they might be more sociable compared to other students. They adapt themselves to other realities, have other opinions and points of views, and are more adapted to real-life situations when they will meet new people every day. As I argue, the first and the second option have benefits and issues. The better option is to choose a hybrid model, mixing both options to improve the students' knowledge and adapt them to different situations. We can only choose a teacher for the students' first five years and after that make them choose a different teacher each year. In this model, we can have the benefit of both options and reduce the bias we could have by adopting only one option. If we analyse our learning model, we can see a lack of opportunities for learning that restricts the skills of students just because we don't think about our learning models. We need to try something different to have different results. Think about the possibilities we have today if we use the digital tools that are available. We have the chance to create a model that really changes the way we learn things. Think about it.

Video games are very popular with children. However, some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, but others believe that they may have some positive effects. Like other things in life, playing video games has no positive or negative impact if done in moderation. Let's share some examples: if you drink too much, it will have a negative impact on your life, if you don't drink it will have a negative impact as well because you won't have social interaction. On the one hand, if you watch the news every day, you will go crazy, on the other hand if you don't see any news, you will be uninformed. As you can see, when we talk about extreme behavior, we are talking about problems and negative impacts on our life. The issue is not playing video games and having a positive or negative impact, the issue is to balance usage to only have benefits without problems. Some parents argue that video games increase children's violent acts, but it has not been proven. Some children have psychological problems that do not originate in video games, these children need to be treated as isolated cases and not as normal cases applicable to everyone. Video games have been proven to improve brain activity and prevent some illnesses, such as Alzheimer and other neurological problems in old age. Video games are an entertainment tool and need be used as such. The only problem that video games can cause is the isolation that occurs when younger people use them for many hours a day. They become antisocial, and this is a real problem to be avoided by parents. As I said before, video games are not a problem as long as they are used sparingly.

Some people believe that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals. These people often think about the benefits to children of seeing live animals and improving their knowledge about the habits and behavior of animals. But these same people don't think about the animals' needs. Capturing and displaying an animal in a zoo is cruel and needs to be banned by governments. It makes no sense to take an animal out of the wild and put it in a jail for people to see it in one place. Other people believe that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. These people think that animals need to be free and humans don't have the right to put them in jails just for fun. The problem with this point of view is the distance that will be created between people and animals. When people see wild animals, they commit to preserving them, and that is good for society and for the planet. I have no opinion about this line of reasoning because both arguments are good enough to convince me. I think we can adopt a happy medium to benefit both sides of society. We can create zoos only with animals that cannot return to the wild. We can create rules to prevent the capture of wild animals and use the zoos as vet centers to treat the animals. In this way, we will create a learning environment for humans and a recovery center for injured animals. What do you think about it?

When a student decides to study in a foreign country, many skills are improved, and many advantages are taken from this improvement in a foreign language, experience in other cultures, other people the student has met, and other advantages such as the ability to relate. The only disadvantage to studying in another country is the distance from home that makes the student feel separated from their family, and they have probably already missed many local events. I wish everyone could study in a foreign country, but it is not a reality for most people. In Brazil for example, only one percent of the population has access to a foreign university, in rare cases a poor person can travel to another country for studying. I had a particular experience studying in another country. I did my master's degree at a French university, and it was a memorable experience, I loved having contact with other cultures and different behaviors. When I travelled to France I didn't have enough ability to speak in English, but that trip required me to study more and as result I am better at conversation and I am able to obtain positions in international companies. If you have the opportunity to study in a foreign country, don't think too much, just accept it and go ahead, you will enjoy the experience and remember it forever. If you don't have enough money to pay for a certain university, try taking language courses, they are cheaper than diplomas and you will experience another culture in the same way, with the same advantages.

Dear Sir, I am writing to complain to you about the ban you made public last month. In the last few months there has been an issue that has dominated among local people. To be more precise, the imposing of a ban on using mobile phones on the public transport system has made many people angry. Moreover, you also made public a ban on using mobile phones in shops and even expanded the ban to restaurants. Firstly, the majority of locals have been fed up with your regulations during the last two years. Instead of including your voters in a debate to find a solution to tackle the problem, you always decide without thinking beforehand. Personally, if I were in the position to give you an assessment, I would give you the lowest rank. Secondly, if we are calling for a better life in our town, we have to have the courage to tackle the problems and not to turn a blind eye to them. What I am trying to say is that locals have come up with an idea and arranged a meeting to discuss it and find a satisfactory outcome appropriate for both sides. Importantly, your presence in the meeting is more than important. So, on behalf of the locals, I am pleased to invite you to discuss our recommendations at the meeting, which is being held at the local pub on May 13th at 6 P.M. We are looking forward to seeing you there and I do hope we finally find a solution to our common problem and contribute to a better life in our town. Yours sincerely,

Telling the truth is one of the ways of communication among people. However, some aspects have a major impact on our outcome. To give an illustration, the expression of the truth or a lie depends on if we are talking to an old person, the listener's mood, or even if we are subordinate to the listener we are speaking to at that moment. What is more acceptable, to tell the truth or a lie? Firstly, before making a decision, to tell the truth or a lie depends on how well we know the person who is listening to us. A good illustration of telling the truth is supported by our knowledge of the personality of the person we want to speak to. To be more precise, for a positive attitude and to be in balance with the person, we decide to tell the truth. Conversely, we intentionally try to avoid telling lies. Instead, we say things differently or present them in a way that is not clear. As a result, it gives us a chance to put some arguments. The situation could turn against us if we intentionally lie on the first try. Telling the truth or a lie depends on the situation and the receiver of our speech. We lie intentionally to avoid difficulties when we know that our arguments would not be supported by an idea. In my view, it seems reasonable to consider the way we present that something is wrong. When I am in the position to choose the truth or a lie, I always try to see things from different angles, not to turn a blind eye to one side of it. Last but not least, the most important fact in interpersonal communication is to listen and show an interest. It is the most persuasive way to have positive communication and reach a result, which brings benefits to both sides.

Music is everywhere. Existing without the rhythm, sounds and beats of the music we love, cannot be defined as life. Living life to the fullest means transposing our emotions and feelings in notes, making them eternal. Music encapsulates most of our precious memories and unforgettable moments. Nothing compares to it. Music gives colour to our lives and it has therapeutic effects, calming and making us feel amused, fulfilled, and reassured. It can be a safety valve, a safe anchor when you feel lonely and depressed. A melody is a great medium to better know and keep in contact with oneself, friends and family. Two people with similar tastes in music connect instantly. Those who are fond of playing the same instrument or have a flair for writing the same kind of poetry also get along really well. Music Helps Establish a Connection with Self Connecting with one’s inner self is an essential factor in leading a positive and wholesome life. The best way to go deep down and connect with oneself is through meditation. While many people try to meditate only a few are able to do it successfully. Most people find it hard to sit in silence and dive deep inside and thoughts usually make concentration impossible. Music can make this process easier. Music can calm the mind and help us to focus. There are many guided meditation audios and videos that can help you meditate with ease and develop a connection with your inner self. Music Helps Establish a Connection with Those Around Why do you think social gatherings have soft music being played in the background or a full-blown DJ installed? Well, this is because music has the power to build a positive atmosphere and connect strangers instantly. People often make new friends on the dance floor and music can be a tool to express inner emotions that words cannot do. Life without music would be empty, a vacuum that cannot be substituted by any other form of art. It can turn your sensations upside down and change the mood of your day. Every song I used to listen to in my childhood and girlhood keeps a treasure of unforgettable times and lifelong relationships.

A good example is that children spend more time on social networks and by playing games on their mobile phones. Do our children need medication for their addiction to technology? I am in two minds about it. On one hand, in most cases, the technology is not to blame. In early childhood, children are equipped with new technology. What is more, the natural environment in which young children grow and learn is intentionally replaced by the new technology. This artificial environment supports different stimuli of the brain. For instance, they do not think that doing sports activities is what they need. The simple reason for that is they get out of their comfort zone. Getting out of their comfort zone represents effort and there is no persuasive argument to do it. Some individuals can see doing a sport as a way of relaxation of the body or the brain. Others just want to break their previous records. Sports activities provide satisfaction. Conversely, someone can feel it frustrating. On the other hand, technology can have a positive effect on our brains. As evidence of that is using technology as a tool of education. In my view, doing sport is an important part of our life. It makes us positive if we do some sport activity regularly. By and large, it keeps us in good shape. For example, when we get older, we do not rely on others to give us a helping hand. As far as I am concerned, if I were in the position to change the lifestyle of the children from their childhood, I would have made it mandatory to do some sport based on their choice at least 3 times a week. No matter how old the children are. It is our moral responsibility, to do something positive for the health of our children. Last but not least, it is not too late to act tomorrow.

Whether music is essential in our lives might appear like a completely vain question to be asking at first. However I'd like to dig deeper into this topic since I find music crucial for my life, moreover, I can't remember a day in which music hasn't been a part of it. Ancient people used to make sounds which turned into melodies and created the first music without even realizing it. There must have been a reason for coming up with a completely new thing such as music. Since then music has been a part of rituals, such as celebrations and even been used for comforting someone feeling blue. Needless to say, never have I met a person who would have told me they didn't listen to any music. There is no need for a specific genre, every single person listens to something. By simply singing some melodies in their daily lives. In conclusion, yes I do believe music is necessary for our lives. In conclusion yes I do believe music is necessary for our lives from making us feel understood in those lyrics of songs to motivate us while doing chores.

In my opinion, the opportunity to live on your own is amazing. I lived with my parents until I was eighteen years old and after that I ingressed university in another city and that is why I needed to live alone. I learned a lot from this situation, such as you need to respect other people's space and they need to respect your space, other things like taking care of your money, feeding yourself, cleaning the house and studying alone and this is good to prepare you for the future , when you won't have your parents to look after you. I believe that people who don't experience these things will suffer more in the future with routine problems like work or a wife or husband than people who lived alone during their college phase. When you don't have your parents around, it's a great time to grow up and take charge of your life. Of course there are exceptions, I know some colleagues who studied with me and did not live with their parents and still grew up like me, but most colleagues who studied far from their parents grew up fast and after they finished the course at university they preferred to continue living on their own own. In my opinion, when you leave your parents' house and live alone, it's very difficult to go back and accept the rules that your parents want in their house, you want your space and your freedom and that's why you don't acceptreturning.

Dear Sam, I hope this email finds you well. As we both know, tomorrow we finally meet. It has been ages since I've seen you since the last time! I'm very glad that you found some time to share with me and we can have a little fun. Is 6:00 PM as a time for our meeting fine with you? I thought we could watch some movies like in the old times, so if you have a favourite one you can bring it with you. I would really like to watch "Okja." It was hyped up by the media, but also praised by the fans for marvelous special effects. Also, if you could bring some snacks with you it would be great. I'm planning to prepare a hot meal (my speciality) and some cocktails. My house is at the corner of Franciszkanska and Mlynarska streets. It's next to the big clothing store, so I'm sure you will find it easily. Though if you have any problems finding the way, do not hesitate to just call me. I hope to see you soon. Love, D.

Sam, I´m looking forward to having you in my house tomorrow. I was thinking of all of the fun things that we could do. I thought that we could play different board games or try some new video games. Maybe we could do them both too. If it does not rain, we should also go outside and play soccer and basketball with my neighbours. They are really cool and easy to be with. So, I think you'll fit in just as fast as I did. You probably have some ideas too, so we can share them and make this day a perfect one. You can come right after lunch if your parents agree to it, of course. You don´t need to bring much, just your clothes and a toothbrush. That´s all. I´m not sure how well you know my location, so here are some tips on how to get here. I am pretty sure that you are familiar with John´s market. So, you will have to turn right after this market and then you count three traffic lights. After, you turn left, left and right. My house is at the closed condominium called Bright Garden. When you get here, just text me and I will meet you at the front. If you have any doubts, just call me and I will try to help you.

How important is music in our lives? I think music is very important in our lives. You know, when we were kids, we listened to a lullaby to fall asleep. When we are 3 to 5 years old, we learn music at school. When we are teens we listen to music every day. Pop, rock, EDM, classical,.... many types of music for everyone. Music is a different way to tell a story. Anthems are a story about a country. Love songs are a story about love. It doesn't matter when the music appears, the story still has its meaning. Some music makes us feel enthusiasm, some music makes us feel bad, some makes us relax. Do you ever imagine what the world would be like without music? I can't imagine that. Life will be very boring.

My favourite food is home-made pizza, I love it because it is my father that makes it, but we usually eat it once a week and that is very sad. We usually eat it on Saturdays for dinner but sometimes it can be Sunday instead. I love it because the ingredients are all homemade and I like how my father makes the dough with a lot of cheese and a lot of bacon.

To start a discussion about the problem of doctors not going to rural areas, we first need to talk about a common behavior shared by all human beings. It is common knowledge that our parents teach us since our childhood to be the best person as possible in our lives. It's not unusual for everyone to learn things such as the importance of money to have a good or a comfortable life. We learn to value our time to achieve the best position possible. So, when talking about the medical doctors who choose a comfortable life in the city, where they can earn more money, it easy to understand why they choose this option. If I were in the same position, I would choose the same option. When we think about our life-time, we remember that our life is limited, we have a certain quantity of time to spend, and we need to spend this time in the most intelligent way possible. There are more people living in cities than in rural areas, people who live in cities are richer than people who live in rural areas. For this reason it is not rational to choose to live in another place. In my opinion, the reasons which made doctors choose to live in cities rather than in rural areas is only rational. It's not normal to choose a worse option if you have a better one. But, it is not a rule, there are some medical doctors who choose to live in rural areas. These professionals don't need a lot of money, they just want to help poor people or they want to have a peaceful life living in a place just for the lifestyle. To sum up, I think this is a personal choice, we as humans and individuals need to choose what is better for us, despite other opinions.

When we talk about offices, we nearly always think of a large room located in a new office building in the center of a city, but this way of thinking is just a stereotype, in many cases the offices are located in places that cannot have the correct infrastructure that the company needs to operate or they just want this location as a strategic option. We cannot determine a single layout for all offices because companies have different realities. Some companies need an open plan office for their employees, other companies want different and separate spaces to have more control over interactions for security reasons or for commercial reasons. In my opinion, the reality of work is dramatically changing after Covid-19, many people around the world have found a new way of working, they have been starting work from home and enjoyed it. I don't think offices will ever be the same as before 2020. People today feel more comfortable working from home, and this workforce behavior is a challenge to traditional business models that force their employees to return to the office. Many people won't go back to their old model. We have two main differences in the office work model, the first is a model that involves knowledge, for this type of professional, sharing information and experience is more important than working hard alone. The other type of workforce is those people who work on bureaucratic tasks that don't change or that don't require creativity. This type of person can work alone for many hours and have no problem with it. Despite the models we have, one thing is very important today, companies need to find a way of working that improves the quality of life of their employees. They need to define this as a common goal for the company.

Some high schools require students to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion this is a good way to improve students' skills, with this hands-on volunteering experience they will learn about the importance of charity and be more socialized professionals compared to students who do not have the same experience. When students participate in charitable actions, they learn how important it is to society as a whole. A person who has enough time, energy and money to volunteer in any activity will be more respected and recognized than others who have the same opportunity and don't use it to improve. When high schools require students to volunteer for some local work, they are not just trying to improve the quality of life for the poor, they are trying spread good deeds and create empathy with students. A person who grows knowing how other people need their help will work better as a team member than students who are more antisocial. Volunteering is good for everyone, students have a lot of free time and could use that time to do something important. When an employer sees volunteer work on a resumé, he immediately recognizes the importance of that person who is trying to get a job with him, I have no doubt that that task is important for the lives of the next generations, they will grow up with fundamental values that will change our society to a better way than we have improved it at this time. This kind of requirement must be mandatory in every high schools in every country in the world, this process would certainly make our world a better place to live in.

A common topic when we talk about school requirements is music classes. This is controversial and divides opinions between parents and students. Despite the noble goal involved in this requirement, some people are not able to play any musical instrument or don't feel comfortable attending a class where they are obliged to learn how to play a musical instrument. There are schools where students must attend music classes, in others they may not be required, and in some schools there may be no music classes at all. In my opinion, schools should offer the possibility to attend a music class, but it should be optional and not a requirement. I will use my example to explain my own point of view. Today I'm thirty years old and don't play any musical instrument. This is not a problem for me because I used my time to learn things that are useful to me. For me, knowing how to play a musical instrument is not an important thing and I'm happy with this decision. If I had been forced to attend a music class when I was at school I certainly would have hated it. Despite these arguments, I think music classes are an important thing for students who want to learn how to play some instrument. I just think these classes should not be a requirement, they might be optional. Music as art is important for our society, there are many people around the world that love playing music and this is not a problem. Music is a fuel for our mind. The majority of people listen to music every day and this shows how important it is for humanity. To sum up, just learn what makes you happy, don't worry if you are not able to play an instrument, just learn how to do it.

When we are undergraduates, we are just at the beginning of our life, we don't know many things and we are experiencing new realities, feelings and living new moments that build our personality over time. Some students move and live alone while others choose to live at home with their family. Let's talk about these two options. Both options have advantages and disadvantages. The first option improve more experiences to students than the second one. When students decide to live on a campus or rent an apartment close to the university, they will learn how the adult life is, they will understand a reality that was different to the one they have in their parents' house, they will learn things that only life impose to them. Living alone is a challenge for everyone, but it is a great moment when they can grow faster. The second option is more comfortable, when a student keeps living at their parents' house during college time. They will save more money compared to moving away to live on their own. In contrast, many opportunities and experiences will be lost comparatively. Another advantage of living with parents is the fact that they have more free time to focus on the subjects they need to learn. Both options are good. Sometimes a student doesn't have the option to choose. A student must live with his parents because he hasn't enough money to live by himself, for example. Sometimes, the parents' house is very far from the university so that the student must move away to live closer and spend less time and money. Despite the options, the most important thing for students is not this short time they will live with parents or not, what matters is learning new things and being happy with what they have at the moment.

I want a calm and long life rather than a short and intense one. I prefer staying at home than partying. I pay more to relax than to have adventures. This is me, and this is how I think about having a happier life. I love studying and sometimes I get immersed in reading a book. if I need to choose between a quiet place to stay for the weekend and a place full of people like a beach, I'll definitely choose the first option. I don't judge people who like noise and overcrowded parties but in my opinion this is not something to do every weekend, life is more than that. If you are involved in noise and have a lot of intense days, you'll never think about important things, you need some time to reflect on important matters, get to know yourself more deeply and relax, take it easy, life is not something you can use intensively, you need to balance your routine to achieve a healthier way of life. I would like to live a long and peaceful life until 100 years old, some people will argue that this living model is not exciting, but I would argue that is exactly what I want. I work every day for one reason, I work because I need money to retire as quickly as possible to enjoy life as slowly as possible. Use your time conscientiously, you only have one chance in this world, don't reduce your time on earth, take this recommendations and you will enjoy the journey.

It is impossible to always tell the truth, if we think about our daily activities we'll realize that we tell little lies to ourselves. It's normal to tell lies to other people, what we need to avoid is telling lies that will harm others, this needs to be avoided. We have two different types of lies, the small, safe lie and the big, harmful lie. The first is used when we need help someone to be happier, for example, when your wife asks you if she is fat, you are going to lie obviously. This lie is not a problem for society, it is used to make your wife happier and have no harmful consequences. Problems occur when you use a big harmful lie, sometimes we use this mechanism to gain benefits for ourselves and in many cases this lie will harm other people, it is a painless gain. In my opinion, lying is a natural and implicit act of human beings, we need to use it with caution and think about the possible results our lie will have on the behavior of others. If a lie is discovered, people will no longer trust us. Keeping a lie hidden is difficult, at some point the lie will be discovered and we need be prepared to face the consequences. To summarize, I think our world is full of lies. Every person lies to us at some point, so the best we can do is accept it and work to identify when a lie is told.

Music has been the art with the most changes and evolution in history. Currently, in society there are many different styles of music and for that reason there is the most interesting question for the music industry, "Do we need music in our life?" I think that at the moment music is as important as food because there are many difficult moments where we feel sad and disappointed and music can make us feel special and comfortable. In my view, I think that music helps people to communicate their feelings and feel better with themselves. I couldn't imagine my life without music, it could be so different and sad. Actually, many studies say that music helps people's health because music can lower stress and anxiety. Music is even like a treatment for people that suffer depression and live in constant sadness. For me music is the best way to say lovely things to others. However, people think that not all music is good, but I don't agree because it does not matter if music is created with a piano or drums, it will be a perfect melody.

Sometimes there are people who ask themselves if music is important in their lives, and without any doubt the answer is yes. Music is present in most events in our lives, for example, when we are celebrating a wedding, the most important situation is the dance between the couple. When we are celebrating, a bad song could make the party stop or a good song could increase the fun. In general, life without music would be very boring. When I am with friends, I usually say "if music didn't exist, I would have to invent it," and this is true. In my personal case, I listen to music every day. When I train, I listen to music, when I drive, I listen to music, I listen to music all the time. Without music, our lives would be less interesting, we would not see films with enthusiasm, and the queues in the supermarket would be worse. My point of view is irrefutable because we have many online platforms to take music with us anywhere and anytime.

In my opinion, l think learning to speak a foreign language is not as important these days as it was in the past. Now let me tell you why. In the early 1500s-1700s, the English got off to a late start with the whole colonizing thing. They wanted to expand their territory. They watched as Spain and Portugal quickly snapped up land in the Americas during the 1500s and made a fortune on gold, silver, and sugar. Plus, the English's long-time enemy, the French, were starting to explore the north. So the English wondered if they should start colonizing too. But there was a problem, if they wanted to go colonizing, they had to know a lot about the places they were going to colonize. If they didn't, they might fail to make some deals with the native people in the south. So the king authorized a public education class to let sailors know where they were sailing to, what their culture was, and how to communicate in their language. But the native Americans didn't speak an easy language, so it took months to know the basics of it. Back to the present, we don't need a lot of effort to try to know what someone's saying. We just take out our phones and download a translator. Easy-peasy.

Nowadays, we spend most of our life working at the office. Therefore, it might be utterly useful to analyze which model of office is better to achieve the huge goals enterprises face in this tough times. In the following lines I will discuss this issue. On the one hand, it is pretty common to see people working in enclosed cubicles. Rarely do we find a work place where employees can work in large and pleasant offices like the Google ones. Despite the evidence that these open design offices empower the productivity of enterprises, it seems to me so hard to find something like this in our cities. On the other hand, it is widely known that workers can perform better if their employer gives them a comfortable space to work where they are able to see what is going on in the office. As far as I am concerned, feeling being part of the company, workers will give their best to carry on with the daily affairs of the enterprise. In brief, unless we absolutely change the way we work and where we work it will be hardly difficult to improve the workers' life. Hence, it is imperative to reconsider the design of our offices. In this case, I totally believe that open design offices are a good deal better than classical ones. To sum up, I vividly believe that it is time to keep our offices up to date and redesign our work places in order to make them more practical and useful for twenty - first century needs.

Aiming at high moral values has long been regarded as a hallmark of a modern, sensible human being. That feature alone accounts for our perception of moral superiority. Thus, it is not nonsensical to deduce that deprived of spirituality, moral challenges, and reliability, human beings find themselves threatened in their core values. Does really life revolve all about meeting basic needs? Absolutely not. On the face of it it seems that truthfulness is a baseline for all successful human interactions, yet, after close examination an entirely different picture emerges. What if the benefits of fibbing or even downright deception overhaul the perks of truthfulness? Let's take a closer look at a handful of instances in which this is the case ranging from heartbreaking home truths, terminal illness, brutal truths of life to an item of apparently neutral information potentially capable of wreaking havoc and destabilising human lives. Yes, in order for a person to thrive it is permissible to sift, omit, or bend the hash truth. It falls within the guidelines for affection for a friend claim. A different approach entails going around the houses and attempting to avoid the burning issues. Instead of a fully-fledged condemnation, a softer approach is advisable in order for the interlocutor not to feel threatened. Once in a while simply omitting a fact might potentially give rise to enhanced communication between the parties. But is it worth it? There is no black and white answer to this question.

Dear Mayor, I am writing in reference to the supposed proposal of the banning of the use of mobile phones in certain public spaces of our beloved town. As far as I am concerned, this sort of decision should be discussed with citizens after taking such an important and shocking decision which I totally believe will have a dramatic impact on our daily life. Firstly, I can come to imagine which sorts of security problems our town council want to solve. Seldom do we find someone who is not watching the screen while he is walking or on the bus. Definitely, avoiding the use of mobile phones in certain public areas, our town will be a more secure one. However, I am not quite sure if it will be the best chance to fix this issue. Secondly, I reckon that our society needs to disconnect but I consider that these sorts of measures are outside the law. In fact, I wonder if it is constitutional. Although these sorts of gadgets can have a negative impact on our society, they have proved to be utterly useful. Therefore, banning them can be not only a catastrophic decision but an unconstitutional one. In brief, we need to change ourselves in order to mend this huge issue. All in all, it is an individual problem with social repercussions. As a result, I consider that other types of measures are needed if we want to improve our city and to boost our quality of life.

My favourite season of the year. My favourite season of the year is winter and now, in January, we are in the middle of the winter. I like it the most because in winter, we can wear warm clothes, we enjoy the fires in the fireplaces, we have the Christmas holidays, and if we have a family, we can spend time with our families. I prefer winter to summer because you can do many activities without the heat of summer, when some activities are dangerous, like sports. There are activities that you can only do in winter, like skiing, snowboarding, and others. In winter, cities are beautiful, the streets and stores have their Christmas decoration and walking there is fun and beautiful. Some people say that summer is better, but I strongly believe that I have waited a lot of time to be in winter and definitely, I am going to enjoy all the fun, food, and time that winter gives me. Finally, I would like to tell you something, if you don't enjoy winter, it is because you are not doing things in a correct way. I wish you a happy winter.

Nowadays, it is often said telling the truth is always such an important issue, but it has always been an option to tell lies . On the one hand, telling the truth you will never be worried about what you have said. Therefore, it is highly possible you would be more confident if you had not told any lies in your life. But seldom do we find people of that kind. However, you could be in trouble as long as you tell the truth. Unfortunately it is widely known how dangerous a situation could be when you tell the wrong person what he is not willing to hear. On the other hand, lying may save you in some contexts from worse consequences. Although it is impossible to lie the rest of your life, lying would be utterly useful in certain situations such as when you were a child and you had not done your homework. However, fortunately, in other major issues where a lot of diverse and different interests are in play, people generally get caught when they tell a lie. But, sadly, telling lies you cannot only hurt yourself but other people's feelings. To sum up, I vividly believe lying should never be acceptable as far as it can cause a negative impact in other people's life. As far as I am concerned, we must be the only ones responsible for our actions and hence for our lies.

Dear Sam, I'm writing you this email about a music concert that I went to. First of all, it was really amazing! Ed Sheraan performed there for a while and then came my favorite one, Shawn Mendes, he performed for a whole hour! For me that was the happiest hour of the entire day! Then there was a band that I didn't know, but their music was so optimistic and full of life, I really loved it. Secondly, even though the concert was very crowded it was very safe. There were security guards everywhere and they were making sure there was a safe environment for us all. They checked our bags carefully at the entrance and they took every sharp thing and they also took fireworks because as you know, there were a lot of problems because of fireworks at the last concert. so they were making sure everything was safe inside this time. I really wish you had been there with me, you would have enjoyed it a lot! But it's fine, we will go together to the next one so make sure you put that in your future schedule. Have a nice day Sam! Yours, Sophia

Telling the truth has been always considered by many people that are very good people and they tell the truth about everything on all occasions, but.... Is always telling the truth the best option? Telling the truth is one of the best options, but not in everything, if you gotta say that, for example, a dog of a person has died and he/she is asking you and you know what happened, you can tell him/her that his/her dog has disappeared to not make them very sad about their dog dying, but not always telling a lie to try to " fix " something could fix that, it could end up in a very very bad situation, as an example, you can say that you didn't break up that jar, but if your mother believes it, she then will go to ask your brother/sister, then your father and then they will ask you to say what you saw, and if you lied the punishment of breaking a jar will be bigger as you lied to them too. What you can do to prevent those scenarios is you could take like 10 seconds to analyse the question they asked you to think about " shall I tell the truth? Or a little lie? " then you can say the best option, but in the scenario where you couldn't think about it you can just say " I don't know " .

Nowadays, as long as we fortunately have more free time, one issue has become really important to consider, namely, how do we want to live our lives? On the one hand, living such a calm and relaxing life, you will probably live until 100 years old. However, although living a long life could have its advantages, I sincerely believe it will tragically end up by being depressing. Not only because it is unnatural not to feel that way after all those years, but also because it will be severe and ruthless. Living longer than your relatives is a harsh punishment as you see your relatives die. On the other hand, having a long life is not required in order to have a full life. As far as I am concerned, living an intense life, you will wisely appreciate every single second of your existence. What is more, you will be sufficiently free to do whatever you want with your life as long as you know you will die. Only when we understand our temporary existence, will we be able to move forward and live our dreams. In brief, unless you want to have a boring existence, I highly recommend you to be as active as possible in your daily life. A lot has to change in ourselves in order to live the way we dream. To sum up, I totally believe an intense life is a good deal better than a long and boring life.

I like to sleep with a small light on and there's no noise. I sleep at least 7 hours and if I sleep less than that then I feel unwell for the whole day. That's why I like to sleep for 7-8 hours a day. Even during the day I like to take power naps for 30-45 minutes. I do not like to sleep in a room with a lot of noise. I like to sleep in a very quiet place with good vibes.

Hello Alex, I send you this email to apologise to you because I can't go to the party this Saturday afternoon. I know you have been preparing this party very carefully. Sara has told me you check every meal and drink and listen to all music to make sure everyone will feel comfortable at the party. I really regret that I can't go there. On Saturday afternoon I have to watch an episode of Misthy. I love watching the love of Misthy and Bank. What do you think about moving the party to another day? Or could we meet each other next week? My friend just recommended a new restaurant near my house. I see the price is good, the food has a good rating too. The restaurant's name is " Take a bite ." Do you want to have dinner with me at this restaurant next week ? Send me an email to reply. Love you.

Hi Alex, First of all, I would like to thank you for inviting me to your birthday party this Saturday. Unfortunately, I can't come. I am very sorry about that, I really want to come and have some fun with you and all our friends. This morning, my mother told me that this weekend my grandparents will arrive from Agrigento because it's my grandfather's birthday. It is extremely rare that they leave Agrigento and take an airplane to come here. They have already organized the whole weekend. Sunday morning my father will go to the airport to pick them up; in the afternoon, we are going to meet my sister's family in RC and in the evening we are going out for dinner to a special place to celebrate my grandfather's birthday. Saturday morning will be free, however, in the afternoon we have to go to the Museum of Contemporary Art to the opening of the new installation. I know that it isn't the same, but we can meet another day. What do you think about a pizza the next weekend, maybe Friday? Let me know! Ed

Hi Alex, Thanks for your kind invitation to the party this Saturday afternoon, but it will be impossible for me to go. I apologise for not telling you earlier, but my youngest daughter is not well this morning. It started last night. I don’t know yet if it is a cold or flu or anything. She is extremely sick, I should maybe consult a doctor. She has a high fever, and she coughs a lot. I’m very worried. I think I’m going to go to the emergency ward in the hospital instead. I suggest you wait for another moment when we could meet. I suppose that the next Saturday, all will be back to normal, but we will see. I’ll call you back as soon as possible to give you news.

Hey Alex, I hope you are fine. I am writing to you because I should tell you something. I know your party is this Saturday afternoon, but I won't come. I'm sorry to say that. Let me tell you why. You know as well as I do that my grandmother was very sick. She was taken to the intensive care unit a few days ago. The doctors said it was getting worse, and I had to be prepared for anything. This morning, the news of her death reached me. I knew I would be losing her, but you know, she is my favorite person, and she was my only family. We may meet next month because I need to be alone for a while. Please don't worry about me. I will be better than now. This party is crucial for you, so you focus on it. Have a good time at your party.

What is my favourite season? This is a very good question and answering it is not simple. However, my favourite season is autumn. I love autumn because it is a season of change. I can see the change all around me. The temperature is warm and the sun is not so hot. The days are short and the sun goes down early. I can see the change on the trees. The leaves change their color from green to different shades of red, like orange, yellow, and brown. And the leaves on the trees are fewer, they fall down and cover streets, gardens, or paths. The mountains are completely colored. I like this season because I can stay at home with a hot cup of tea and read a book while the weather outside is bad. In this season I love to go out with friends or go out for a short running session with my boyfriend. I love to feel the cold breeze on my face. I like to go to the mountains searching for mushrooms. And what about yours? What is your favourite season?

Dear Mr Smith, Last month, we had a conversation about my near future and the subjects that I could study this summer and finally I chose French. I chose French because I strongly believe that the more languages that I have, the better for my future, and as I study English, I think that the next one should be French. I saw a course in Paris for the next month and I want to take it and because of that I would like to ask for a letter of recommendation written by you. If I had the opportunity, I would travel to Paris in two weeks to find an apartment. Finally, I would appreciate any advice that you could give me, because I must pull my socks up if I want to pass the tests. I hope to hear from you soon.

I recently discovered Write and Improve, a new writing tool for English learners that is easy to use and helps you write better. The main features of the tool are many tasks that you can use to write texts and submit them for correction, the application identifies what is wrong and makes recommendations to improve your writing. This tool is useful because you can see recommendations in real time. It shows you a grid with the IELTS scale and the position of your text between levels A1 to C2. It shows the words that are wrong and the tasks have different levels. You can start at Beginner level, then advance to intermediate and advanced level. There are tasks to improve your business writing and new tasks are added monthly. One thing I like about the tool is the option to write the task I want, I don't have to do all the intermediary tasks to go to the advanced level for example. I have some difficulties and I miss some resources like tips to use in my texts like the right use of collocations, how I can improve my sentences and resources to help me create better phrases. Some recommendations to improve the tool include: more rewards to engage the writer, tips to help with writing, a graph with filters to show all our progress through the levels and a personalized study plan. Maybe we can have a guide to compare our writing evolution to some guide ruler, are we on the right path or not?

Hello, I heard about a plan to ban mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. Who has had this idea? I ask because there is no possibility that people will not use their mobile phones in these places. What was the person proposing this thinking? Today we use our smartphone to do many things, some people pay for public transport with an app, use virtual reality to try on clothes and use their cameras to access restaurant menus through QR codes displayed on the tables. There are no laws that will restrict the use of smartphones anywhere, there is only one place where people don't use their smartphones. I'm talking about high security areas where these devices are restricted by law. If the intent of this plan is to reduce mobile phones use to improve people's quality of life, banning it is not the right answer. We need to teach people about the health problems that using their smartphones for long hours causes on their health. We can establish rules of social behavior for some places, not to force people do what we want, but to achieve our goals by making people choose themselves the correct behavior in those places. We just have to make suggestions to create the right culture, people's habits will change naturally to suit the local culture. This is the right way to influence them to do what we want.

Hi Alex, I hope you're well. Thank you for your invitation to the party this Saturday. I am afraid that I can't come because I already had an appointment with my parents, who are living separately. They'll have a 25th wedding anniversary next month. Before that my sister and I decided to give a small gift to them. We will give a one-night stay at the Ritz, London. We started planning this event a few months ago. We didn't even mention it. Everything is going in secret. We are so excited to see our parents happy. Honestly, I am very sorry about the party, on the other hand. I haven't seen you for a long time and the party would give me a great opportunity to reunite with my college friends. I want to know how they have been. I will have some free time next month. If you are available, I want to talk with you over a drink. One more thing, I ask you to say hello to everyone for me at the party. I hope you have a wonderful time. Melon

From: Sam Hi, Alex, l' m so sorry that l can' t go to your party, l will give you a gift as an apology. Sorry! Oh, and speaking of being absent, let me tell you why l won't be at the party and you will know everything. It begins at a restaurant. Me and my family were at a KFC fast food place. We had already placed our order and were finding a place to sit. The ground floor was full, so we headed up to the upper floor to sit. But just as we headed up, l slipped on a not-entirely-drunk bottle of juice. That' s it. The next minute l found myself lying on the floor. Moaning and feeling awful. When we were at the hospital, we found out that my leg was broken due to the uncontrolled free fall from the stairs. l have to have surgery so that my leg bone will heal. The whole cost took a big bite out of mom and dad' s bank account. But luckily, our financial problem was solved by the money we get for suing the fast-food place.

Almería, I live in Almería, a place where you have a huge range of things to do. You can go shopping at a mall called "Torrecárdenas" or at the boulevard, where you will find amazing things. If you wanted to do cultural activities you would have to go to the "Alcazaba" or the Pakita museum, where you'd find many exhibitions. However, if you are a nocturnal mammal you will enjoy the many clubs and restaurants that we also have in the boulevard, although they are more expensive than the bars that we can find in other streets.

Dear Anna, I'm glad to have news from you. I'm learning English for two reasons, first of all during my last trip to London I had to use this language a lot and I couldn't because I had not started with it yet, and I told myself "If I had learnt English, I could speak with people." The second reason is that I want to learn it and I want to have more opportunities in my job, because nowadays English is very important and in the future I will ask for a job abroad and if I don't have the level required, I will not be able to get the job. Finally, everybody knows that there are better opportunities abroad than in our country. Drop me a line.

First of all, I gave you my spare keys two weeks ago and you put them into the cabinet in your hall. You don't have to worry about our dog because it died last year and we don't have or want more pets for the moment. You will have to water the plants in our patio and in our living room, but be careful and don't spill water on the floor because it's made of wood and it's more delicate than other floors. If you can pick up the mail from our mailbox, we will be very grateful, but only once in a blue moon, not daily. Finally, I would like to ask for a little favor, can you please look at the electricity box? It is behind the door and we are worried because we left a lot of food inside the fridge and we have had many electrical shortages. We will be forever grateful.

Nowadays, because of the internet and globalization, we have more hobbies and new ways to spend our spare time than previously. I think that I have a lot of hobbies, my mother used to say that I spend more time playing than working. I like playing video games with my laptop, doing exercise alone in my own gym and hanging out with my girlfriend doing new activities. If I could add a hobby, it would be cycling but it will have to be in the future, because it is not my cup of tea. I can only do these activities on weekdays and in the afternoons when I finish my duties, because in the mornings I must work at my base and later do the housework and homework. Finally, I have to say that I have a good balance between my duties and hobbies and I'm very happy with and grateful for my daily routine.

Nowadays we have many resources on the Internet to practise our English skills, in my personal opinion the hardest part to practise is writing, where you have to be very careful and imaginative and where each failure can cost a lot. One of the best tools that the students have to practise this skill is a website called "Write and Improve," where I have been doing a lot of exercises. It is a website where you can practise a lot, and receive good input. You can start from a very low level, to break the ice, until a very hard level, where you would have to be an expert in this subject. It is said that the good things are expensive, but in this case, another advantage could be that this website is totally free, you will only have to register in the website and enjoy learning. On the other hand, this website has some disadvantages in its use, for instance the corrections are made by a machine, and it could not be perfect, leaving some mistakes without correction, or giving wrong feedback. The fact is that a native teacher is much better to learn a language, but not all of us can afford a teacher, for that reason even with those possibilities I continue to recommend this website to you. Finally, I strongly believe that the advantages are much better than the disadvantages and if you use this website, you will find many useful resources.

But when we were planning to go to the same university, his family suddenly emigrated to the United States. Time has passed quickly, we haven't seen each other for the six years since he went to America. So I can't cancel this plan, I'll give him a big and warm hug when I see him at the airport.

Currently, many things are being replaced by machines, and we agree with this fact, although there has been a debate about replacing student's books and workbooks in our whole education system. On the one hand, almost everyone has electrical devices, such as tablets and laptops, which could lead to a new advanced world where we can learn with the latest studies and discoveries, making the study harder but more accurate, without fails. When we use these electrical devices we don't cut trees. We can use these devices for multiple purposes. We can enjoy our learning watching videos, listening to audios, ... and if we use clean energy and buy good products, we can learn without damaging the environment. On the other hand, if we only used these products, books could disappear in a short time. And they have many advantages, they are even a form of art that we have had for centuries. We have to avoid that this form of art become extinct, but for that purpose we have libraries, museums, and other places. Finally, taking all the previous ideas into account, I really think that electrical devices have to replace books and notebooks, but we have to preserve books, because they are part of our history.

Dear Jack, First of all I want to say "Happy Birthday" for your birthday again, as I said last week, I really hope you had a great time with your friends and relatives, and you came back home from the restaurant without any accidents. Secondly, we have a very similar way to celebrate our birthdays in my country, but we usually celebrate our parties in our own homes. There, we usually put balloons on the walls and a small board with little messages from friends and relatives. At home we have celebrated several parties this year and the way was the same in all of them, but next year we will celebrate them in a restaurant like you, because I think that it's better in that way. Finally if you had any doubt about what I said to you, I would explain it to you in an easier way. Drop me a line.

Yes, I like to do exercise. I exercise 5 days a week. The gym offers a good environment and there are many trainers there, so they guide us very well, so I prefer the gym instead of being outside. I like to do gym in the morning only because it makes me feel very good and my mind also works very well. I like to do push ups, dumbbell rows, side planks and lunges. All these exercises keep me active throughout the day.

I watch web series in my free time and I do this only at the weekend. I see there are real life situations where if anyone is facing some issues they can overcome fear of failure after watching web series and it is totally based on real life examples, so anyone can relate to their daily life situations. After watching these types of things we know about society and our country also because we do not visit all the states of a country so we don't know what is happening in those states of a country. So, web series are a good source to make people aware of real life situations. Last time I watched 'Family Man'. I learnt so many things about real life situations that I can face in future. So, if I am aware of the situations and it happens then we do not get too stressed about that situation. So I think web series are the best shows to make people aware of real life situations.

Nowadays, there is a current topic related to foreign languages of whether we should learn a foreign language, or more than one, or not. First of all, we live in a world where each day we are more connected than the previous day. Because of that, the more languages we learn, the better it is for these connections. When you are able to speak other languages a huge amount of possibilities are open to you, you can travel to foreign countries, you can work for more companies, you can be updated with the latest news, ... Secondly, there are a very small group of people with a very particular way of thinking. These people believe that if they are not going to travel abroad, they don't need to learn a foreign language. But you don't need to learn a language because of that, you might need to work for people who don't speak your language in your own country. If you did that you would lose amazing opportunities in your life, opportunities like working in top companies, having the latest gadgets of your sector, and a huge amount of varieties. Finally, I can say that several times I have needed a foreign language in my work and I'm very happy to say that I could do the task thanks to speaking it. Learning a language could be seen as having a mountain to climb, but when you break the ice with the language it will be a cup of tea.

Hello there, As this magazine is looking for some reviews, I'm lending to you reader, my review about Write And Improve. The way I found it: I was looking for some ways to improve my English, why? Because English is the most spoken language and I wanted to do something with it. Now, the interesting part of the review. The first step is a common step, just sign in or log in. After that, you can see in the top left corner, " Welcome (your name) " and a sign out button in blue. As it says, it's to sign out from your account. Below it you'll see " W&I workbooks " . Just click there to open every type of workbook that W&I has. There is the IELTS Academic test, IELTS General Training and B2 First. Below it you'll see " My workbooks'. " My workbooks " is for creating a new workbook or joining one. Below it you'll see " Create a workbook " and as its name says, it's for creating a workbook. Below it you'll see " Join a workbook," and that is just to join a workbook. There is even more than you thought, there are still more things to see. Below the option: "join a workbook" there is the option " Class View " . For now that's for teachers. That helps teachers to see what their students have done. After that you'll see Progress, My account and Help centre. Progress is to see your achievements of W&I, my account is for looking at your profile in more detail, and help centre is for asking for some help, or reporting any errors. Why did I write all that text if you could practice that? Easy, because this is a review of my experience and I wanted to tell English learners that have just found W&I. Anyways, taking my experience with W&I, I could just say that there aren't as many errors as in other websites. The important things are very easily placed and very comfortable for you to find them. Good day. Directly, from an unknown English learner.
