There are lots of important things in our life. However, in most cases, they depend on the priorities we have and acceptation we are awaiting from it. If it fulfils our dreams and aims or not? First of all, let us start with one of the most important things in our life and that is health. Our mind and body will be so much satisfied as we give our body at least the minimum of our time. What I am trying to say is that a certain form of physical activity per week is beneficial in many facets of our life. That is to say, If you lead an active life, your body appreciate it when you get older. On the other hand, those who prefer not to have an active life and their efforts to put their time in any kind of activity have a bad perspective when they get older. Moreover, their lifestyle is probably aimed to work and earning money. All things considered, it seems reasonable to revise our free time and to think it over, if we have what we wanted.

When we are talking about travel, we have to reduce our thinking only about the available method of transportation. There are a variety of transport systems available at the moment. For instance, we can travel on the railway, on the road, in the air and the last possible choice is under the ground. That sounds good. We can travel anywhere and anytime we want. However, if we are want to be somewhere at a specific time and something has happened on our journey, what would we do? Well, the solution is in science and the future. As I have read in the last six months, most of the companies have been trying to bring a solution to get somewhere faster than now. Any researchers brought fast trains and other fast cars. what is more, there is also a car that provides its passengers to get to the airport faster than by taxi. That is a car use a similar system as planes do, but for short distances. Maybe it is a future for the transport system in big towns. It does not produce any emissions lake carbon or sound. As far as I am concerned, I guess that the future of transportation, let say travelling in the air is an issue number one. Finally, it seems reasonable to act for supporting science. There is no choice for the future if we do not want to destroy our environment completely.

In which way the travel will change ? Firstly, by energy. In fact, electric cars are at their apogee, so they can evolue in future energy that is more ecological, less and available. This is actually due to ecological factors and because of the breach of resources. Secondly, because of the design of the cars, there is more technological aspect to cars and it might represent cars of the future. These cars are in new design never seen before like round car, faster, bigger, smaller etc... But the aspect of a car influe notably on his form, this is the aerodynamic that ameliore cars and let them be more beautiful and faster. To conclude, the design is assiocated with the speed factor of cars, and the energy is evoluing so the future car is probably with an inconnue energy, and with a really awesome design that would be surprised everyone. Goodbye see you again !

Firstly, healthy is the fact to have a good health with no huge medical problem, and wealthy is the fact to be rich. Then, some people are really poor and they are ready to do everything possible to be better and have more money, but sometimes their limits are exceeded. It depends on the people who are concerned. Some people have a huge ego so when they have a little bit of power in this word they can't limit them and they do an accumulation of power, but at a certain point, this kind of people lost everything like Napoleon Bonaparte for example. It should be that proposition: we have to limit the two parts and conciliate health and money in the objective to have a better life. You'll be richer because you'll live longer. To finish, health and wealth are linked because with no money it's impossible to buy health in our actually word.

Today, books aren't at their apogee, in fact computers offer a lot of services whose digital books and magazines, books reader are divided in two parts, the first concern reader loyal to real books, the second are open to digital books. But in schools and university, it is different because we're talking about education, to include computers and tablets in schools, this require to think about several factors like how the numerical impact the health ? How the numerical can be used and how much times per day? ... I think computers and tablets should completely replace books in school and university, because it'll be less heavy in student's bag, and there will be fewer problems like lost lessons, moreover resources will be more available, that's really useful when students are absents for example. But books is a part of history, it's a universe which is traditional.

In the first place, I want to specify that I like every season, winter with his calm environment, autumn with his sadness, and spring with his softness. In the second place, summer is my favorite season because my favorite activities are more executed in summer, for example, I really like to dance reggaeton with short, but in another season it's too cold to wear it. Then, in summer the sun comes out earlier and leave later, so I can imagine my day longer and I have more time so I can do more things. Thus, summer is my favorite season, and principally because I am sensible and in summer there are friends, lover, and activities really improving feelings.

For many decades the educational system has brought many changes. As each of us remembers in the 19's we used to learn mainly from printed materials such as books. Our notes during the classes being made by a pencil. Those simple methods of education in schools have survived until now. It seems reasonable to say that there is no doubt that these fundamental things will be used by schools for the next decades. In the last years, the development of the new learning methods in the field of technology is being implemented in schools and they are playing a key thing in education for the future generation. More and more students use their mobile phones, computers and similar tools to share information with others. Internet connection which is being widely spread, provide students immediate access to information they need. Even the students are absent at school, they can simply communicate with their teacher not to miss the class hours. The advantages stated above are playing an important role in implementing new technology at schools. On the other side, schools face many difficulties. There is a lack of money to make their future in education comes true. Lack of money slows down the whole process. Apart from educational institutions that belong to the government. If we want to move forward, we need to change completely the system of financing in the private sector. The implementing of new technology will bring benefits for both the schools and the students. Now, we are balancing at the edge of the new perspective in education. In sight of the future, the schools will be able to offer virtual education. Additionally, students who suffer from different disabilities such as those who can not hear, or see anything would be able to participate as well. Moreover, thanks to science, students who suffer from disabilities would have the same chance to share the same class with students without these disabilities.

In the last months, I have tried out a new program to learn English in a fast and easy way. It was created by a magazine for young English learners. I liked to work and learn with the new program because by using it you improve your English skills and contrary to other English learning programs it is never getting boring. At first, I had my problems understanding the different tools but afterward, I was totally into it. Furthermore, I liked the design of this writing tool. The wrong words were in another color than the correct ones. Thereby, it is easy to write out the wrong words and you can learn them. Additionally, I love the fact that the program is for free and everyone can use it. To give you a more vivid idea of the tool I will describe it for you. On the main window, you have the opportunity to choose your task which you want to practice, or you can choose the button for a random task. After you have chosen one by clicking on it, the program opens a separate window. In which you can write your text on the top of the page the tool tells you what you should write and how many words you should use. I seriously recommend the tool to everybody who learns English. It is a simple option to improve your skills and develop your language skills. Because of this tool, I managed my A-Levels. This should be reason enough to try it out.

When I was 16 years old, I went to Italy, in Alba adriatica and I was really excited. First of all, I was in an hotel with my family, including my sister and her boyfriend, my mother and my father. The hotel was not luxual but it was in front of the sea so it was very esay to walk to the beach each morning and afternoon! The beach was private by the hotel, there was deck chair and umbrellas, the sand was extremely hot so we had to run to the water and it was so funny. The routine was this one: we wake up, we eat breakfast, go to the beach, at 12 o'clock, we return to the hotel, take a shower and go to the restaurant for eating, then we sleep a little and we go back to the beach where we were sleeping, reading, listening podcasts for example or just thinking and swim.

To whom it may concern! Forbidding the use of mobile phones is a topic worth discussing. Especially in public places. The idea of a complete ban might be the solution for all of our daily problems. People in trains would not watch on their phone anymore. There would be more conversation going on. Perhaps, everybody would be more friendly as well. Nevertheless, in my eyes, this idea is an allusion. First things first. Do not the people have the rights to do whatever they want to. As long as they are following the laws. Additionally, it is a rapid step. Nearly everybody is using his mobile in public transport. In shops and restaurants, it might be a good idea. However, if people want to communicate; they do it. The banning of mobile phones would not change that. As far as I can tell, most people do not use their mobile while eating. The old school conversation strategies are not dead. By banning mobile phones people might feel threatened to lose all their rights. And, aren´t their rights the most important object nowadays? This rule would ruin the image of the council and policy. It would start an endless shitstorm until the law is gone. Furthermore, many people would not follow this rule. They just do not care about it. The personal freedom is more important than following a random rule which was not reconsidered enough. It is not my call to if phones get banned or not but it definitely would not be a smart move.

What is the truth ? I think there is a personal truth for each of us, especially in this case, we are not talking about general truth like theorem or formula but we are talking about the truth which is different by the views. Then we are asking if it is ever acceptable to tell a lie. But finally, what is a lie ? I think there is too many kinds of lies but it depends on what people in front of you define a lie. For example, when you hide your bad note, some parents will be really angry and disappointed because for them this is a treason, maybe they can think you are not confident with them. But for other parents you are just a child who is stressed because of bad notes and they will don't notice it. In the first place, this is important to always tell the truth because like everything else in life, the secret of the success is the discipline ! And if you used to tell the truth, then, it will be natural for you to do this. And don't forget this is an important value and principle. But, in the second place, if you want to always tell the truth, that means that you accept the fact to be in danger because some people will ask you the good questions in order to trap you and it can be a serious obstacle in your life. To finish, don't forget that information is the most important ressource so use it well !

In the first place, I think it is important to define some world which are in this question. Firstly, we have to tell what sport we are talking here. When you are in a collective club sport like football or basketball, in most cases, even if you have only three training per week, you have to go to the match on the weekend, if you do skiing, you have to go to the mountains and if you dance you have to be present in the evening events. Secondly, what do you mean besides forced, is this an obligation, what are the official consequences, it needs to be more specific. In the second place I'll say why I agree and why I don't agree. Firstly, I agree because it is a really good thing to have interest for school children health ! Especially because it train her to be disciplined, in fact, if they have to go to the sports three times per week, they are used to be present. Then, they have more responsibility, they know they have to do sport, and they know this is for their health. There is another point we can notice, in effect if they have to do sport, they become atheltics and then they are prepared physically. Secondly, I don't agree because children have to realise their mistakes, so if we force them they lost autonomy, and this is the most important quality as an adult ! For me, sport have to be a choice, you can choose to do sport or be involved in your studies, eventually in spite of sport you can have an other activity, like a reading club or something else. I think it is important to frame chlidren but they have to develop their autonomy.

People are lying all the time. Nevertheless, have you ever asked yourself if it is allowed to lie? Of course, you do. I have asked myself the same question. In the following essay, I am going to state my opinion. If you lied once, no one will ever trust you again. With this kind of action, you broke the trust to another person. And trust is earned. This is the greatest reason why you should never tell lies. It might not happen by the first lie, but always if you overwrought something there are devastating consequences. In my eyes, it is different. You should not tell everybody always the truth. Anyway, you should not lie. To combine both there is one possibility. If you are not talking about the topic you are not lying. Otherwise, if someone asks you a question which you do not want to answer. You could just change the topic. However, if the person who forces you to answer you should tell him or her a lie. This is the onliest way which allows you to lie. You should not lie. Otherwise, you will break the trust. However, if someone forces you to answer and there is no other way out you have all right to lie. You do not have to tell everybody everything. Where would this end? caveats

Many of us are complaining about health problems all the time. We do not have had enough time to take care of ourselves. We assumed different living standards of being for many reasons. On the one hand, some of us changed their priorities. Another key thing to remember is, we assumed to care of health as a second priority after earning money. On the other hand, those who started their active life in their childhood, their habits survived until their adulthood. They fully understood that the most beneficial for life was to keep their exercise routine at least two times per week in a roundabout kind of way. The money took their second place in their personal life. As far as I am concerned, I would say that my personal experience is to stay in shape or to be healthy than to have a lot of money. If I have a power to change something in today's rushed time, I would set out three days off of work, or shorten the work hours in order people have more time for their families.

Learning is one of the fundamental processes that help you to keep your mind in better condition. For example, you make connections among your brain's cells and make your memory is getting stronger. However, people are trying to increase their ability to memorize information through a variety of different ways. On one hand, competition is a basic way to persuade schoolchildren to care about their mental health and develop their ability to pick up information from different sources. Secondly, the middle-aged people prefer to increase their memory through reading and communication with others instead of using school methods of education. An appropriate way of education is to work in groups and communication which seems to be the most important. As far as I am concerned, learning English as a second language offers both, verbal communication and studying. The importance is when you are trying to find a well-paid job, or want to travel. Secondly, learning languages bringing you a new level of positive thinking and expanding your memory needed when you get older.

The school of the future! The world and technology itself, develop in such a quick pace. The current education system is quite different than our grandparents remember. In what ways do you think schools will be different in the future? I believe that learning in class where is other 30 people is not effective, thus to increase the quality of learning the amount of student in the class might be decreased to about 10 people. The other way to improve it is to create appropriate books or online talk so students could learn from home. In the future textbooks will be replaced by personal computers, so you will not have to carry very heavy backpack. The scientists might also find a better system, how to comprehend the knowledge quicker. So, it will reduce years which we spend in school. That is a difficult question to answer, because the future is unpredictable. Howewer, I am sure that the education will be different and more efficient than it is now.

There is a heated debate about whether schools and universities should replace printed materials by new technological inventions? Lots of surveys have been conducted among schools, showing the differences in using printed materials and technology. Results of these surveys were surprising. However, I am in two minds about it. On one hand, the first group included in the surveys were students. They prefer to use technology rather than books. The evidence is provided by their flexibility. For example, you can be online with your teacher when you are absent from school. Not to mention, looking for information on the internet, or share information among other students. Moreover, many printed materials do not need to be updated and that is why they would be provided via the internet. This solution does not seem to be such a big financial burden as buying new printed materials. On the other hand, teachers claim that most of the books need not be replaced by technology. These materials need to be updated. The second reason for this is the prices of implementing the new technology in schools which brings together other problems and take a long time to be fully effective. As far as I am concerned, we live in a new century in which technology is playing the most important role in many fields of education. That is to say, we can not avoid using new technology in our daily life. The technology eases our life in most aspects you think about. However, the basic procedures of education will remain for many years – in a roundabout kind of way.

Every student is different. So each student needs different education to be proper for him. It may be called "tailar made education." But it is very expensive to provide "tailar made education" to students in the present system. Actually thirty or more students are gathered in one classroom. And they are taught at the average level of education. The advanced students are bored. At same time, there are students who can't catch up with the lessons. There are few students who are satisfied in the classroom. It seems that IT and AI will solve this problem. The AI could evaluate academic ability. The computer might guide students to improve their ability. Because the level and speed of lesson is modified for each student, they will seem to be satisfied. If there wasn't group eduation, students' parents would worry that their children lost oppourtunities to learn relationships. Of course I don't like the physical education class with one student who are taught by computer. No matter what anyone says, the group education would remain. But the tailor made eduation will be widespread in the future too.

Tevevision gives us a variety of programs, for example, news, drama, music, talk show, education, religion, and shopping. I don't watch TV much these days. All programs are just one-way. Whatever I want, it forces information to me from the start to the end. These programs frastrate me rather than entertain me. I don't like to watch TV anymore. Educational programs have been educating us in Japan. When I was a child, we watched an educational program on the education channnel. The lessons were like "be nice to the elderly," "don't behave egoistically in public." From this point of view programs can educate. It is really one-way education. The one-way teaching gives us a lot of information and knowledge but doesn't give us an opportunity to learn deeply. I am afraid that we might be brainwashed by the one-way education.

The importance to speak a foreign language has increased in its value. In comparison to the 20th century in which people did not have any possibility to show their language skills has completely turned over now. It is being claimed that the ability to speak a foreign language is dominant among middle-aged people. A popular argument for this is that young people need it in preparation for their future life. A persuasive argument is to work abroad. Secondly, there is a group of people who did not find a persuasive argument to learn a foreign language. Those are elderly people and they would like to spend the rest of their life quietly. My personal view is that they deserve a quiet life – in a roundabout kind of way. In one way or another, today's generation of young people must learn a foreign language because we were not given such an advantage of travel abroad or to apply for a job in other countries.

Dear Sir or Madam, After seeing the information about plans to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, I am writing to give my opinion about this issue. You probably have arguments to support your decision, however you should consider my opinion as there are many people like me who think exactly the same. First of all, I would like to know what is wrong with using mobile phones in public places like buses, shops or restaurant, because I can not find a reason which would be strong enough to ban them in all those places. Furthermore, it can cause many problems to people who will need phones in a bus to call an ambulance or police in emergency. I strongly believe that most people do not like to waste time during travelling in public transport and they use this time to read something interesting on the internet or to communicate with family and friends. Therefore, once you ban using mobile phones you will make that this time will be unproductive for them. Additionally, we use our phones to make a shopping list or make a photo of delicious meal which we ordered in restaurant to write a review on the internet. In conclusion, my friends, my family and I think that this idea will not bring any good benefits to our life, furthermore it may make our life more difficult. I hope to hear that you give up this idea. Yours faithfully, Karol

In your last letter, you asked me to provide you with some information about the concert I visited with my wife last week. As far as I am concerned, my first recommendation is to buy the tickets in advance, if you are intending to go there. We saw many successful singers and their performance was breathtaking. If I have the chance to provide an assessment of their performance totally, I would give them the possible highest ranking. By and large, the venue was surprising and the audience moved me in a better mood. Yet there was one thing that made us happier than ever and it was our unexpected babe. Imagine, you are at the concert and all of a sudden my wife was calling for help. The ambulance arrived in a minute and our daughter was born in the middle of the concert. Finally, as a congratulation, we were awarded by an aplause from the whole public. What is more, due to the event, they sang a song for our newborn girl. It was almost impossible to describe our happiness at that moment - in a roundabout kind of way.

Dear Sir or Madam, I recently heard about your latest idea of banning the use of mobile phones on public transport, shops and restaurants. I would like to share with you my opinion about it. It is a good idea to be honest. In today's world we experience the problem with excessive addiction to our mobile devices. We use it every day and for at least a few hours. When getting into a bus, tram or restaurant we can notice a lot of people staring at the screens of their devices. It is a common problem. doing that we not only lose our concentration but we even lose the ability to talk with other people. It can make us socially anxious. Banning the use of mobile phones in public can prevent us from all sorts of mental illnesses. What is more, we would finally end the recent fashion with posting pictures of food on instagram. I hate when people do it. I still can't understand what might be the purpose of doing things like that. I am very pleased that this horrible fashion is eventually going to an and. And actually I don't know what to write now. I know I can write what I want but in this particular email I can't find more arguments. So basically I will write whatever comes to my mind.

It is widely believed that particular students are doing less sports activities. However, that's simply not the case. It has been supposed that children should do exercises three times per week or even more. There are those who argue that students are lazy and to fight these bad habits, sports are the perfect solution. I totally agree with this statement. Nevertheless, I m a keen and probably already a professional climber, and in my best times, I trained four times per week. There can be no doubt that not every child can adopt these habits. When I started to train climbers, I spent lots of time thinking. How is it feasible that some of them, just refuse to listen, to the advice and instructions of other coaches. If they would be in my group, they would be kicked out, faster than you can twink, particularly those who literally never do what you tell them. Not everybody is made for sports. I am a big supporter of any kind of sport. However, students should not be forced to do exercises. Sports are a lifestyle and a passion and nothing that people do to fight their laziness. Notwithstanding that, I do not support this proposal. I would like to give you another solution. Like I mentioned. Sports are a passion and it might even be somebody's destiny. As far as I can tell, everyone who does not do any sports just did not found the right one. I propose to set up a program, where students have the opportunity to try out different kinds of sports. Taking all these aspects into consideration, I do not agree with the assertion. Sports are awesome! Furthermore, they have an incredible effect on your learning, they are everything, but bad. Nonetheless, to force students to do sports is the wrong way, it would have detrimental effects on students and their opinion of sports. Let them find the sport they love and they will do it all day long.

In my opinion, the topic is very complicated. On the one hand it is important to always tell the truth but sometimes there are situations when it's better to tell a lie. Each issue is different and there is no universal solution to solve every case in a good way for both sides. Telling the truth has both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest advantage is that you are being honest with yourself and what is more important, with the person who you talk to. On the other hand, the truth can sometimes be painful for the other person and many things can change in the relationship between you and he or she. But you can tell yourself that you said what had to be said and you won't be feeling guilty afterwards. On the other hand, sometimes it's better to tell a lie. It is easier and can be less painful for the recipient but not for us. The worst part of telling a lie is that in most cases remorse can be unbearable and eventually we decide to tell the truth. The point is it all depends on the situation. This topic is a bit hard to expand on. At least for me. Sometimes I find it hard to write more about the topic. I have never had a gift for creating a stories.

The popularity of video games among children has increased in recent years. To be more precise, children incline to the playing of video games instead of taking part in activities such as sport which is the key factor in their development. In a view of recent discussions, we can hear arguments that support the idea of playing video games. On the other hand, there are negative arguments as well. From my view, playing video games has a positive impact on children mind. To give an illustration, it supports their ability to react quickly on the situation by making an immediate decision. Secondly, they also develop their imagination in many situations and help them to solve problems such as school tasks. The negative impact of playing video games is described by parents as an inability to solve fundamental tasks relating to our daily life. That is to say, the tasks in which its difficulty is adequate to the age of children. All things considered, it seems reasonable to assume the fact, our children grow up in the 21st century and it is hard to steer clear of the upcoming technology. To put it in another way, our children will be dependable on new technology – in a roundabout kind of way.

I live in the Czech Republic where you can find at least four zoos. Moreover, each of the zoos has offers its visitors a certain kind of entertainment as well. People in our country usually comes to the zoos to see the animals. What is more, the majority want to escape from their busy lives for the weekend. However, a certain percentage of people comes to the zoo to educate their children. Needless to say, we do not see the animals in the zoos as the prisoners, we see them as a thing that has roots in our mind as an entertainment. On the other side, I have never thought about it in the way that those animals belong to nature as well as human. Try to imagine you will take a place of animals in the zoo tomorrow. It seems like a terrible imagination, isn't it? What I am trying to say is that we do not turn a blind eye on animals and make the most for their better future.

Everyone has a dream to have a long and quiet life. People expect that the longer their lives become, the more peaceful their lives will be. However, I think that the opposite is true. I would like to describe my reasoning below. First of all, people need to prepare a lot of things if they live long, which usually requires tremendous burdens in advance. For example, many people are concerned about their future financial plans, especially after retirement, as the average life longevity has been extended more and more these days. Second, there are quite a number of unexpected problems happening all over the world, such as natural disasters, and novel virus turmoil. This proves that the longer people live, the more they will encounter difficulties they cannot control on their own. As a result, it will be rare to find tranquil moments in their daily lives in such disastrous conditions. The last reason is that people never appreciate their precious lives, unless they utterly notice that the clock is ticking. To make the most of every moment, it is so much easier for people to have a short intense life, rather than long and calm one, which might unintentionally mislead that people they have tons of times left. For these reasons, I support the idea that a short but intense life is the better option in most cases.

People have different opinions about the importance of telling the truth. Some insist that it is still acceptable to tell a lie, if necessary. However, I would like to counter this opinion. I will describe my reasoning as follows: First, although people believe that they are very good at hiding their actual feelings by telling a lie, what they think will be unconsciously delivered to the person they are talking with somehow. For instance, children sometimes express their feelings how much they hate their parents. However, deep down, they know their honest feelings are totally the opposite. This example is very straightforwad, but basic theory can be applied to any situation anyhow. Second, once people are used to tell lies to others without feeling guilty, it will easily become their second nature. This will mislead people into having doubts if others’ opinions are trustworthy or not. Any relationship based on a firm trust is essential for any occasion, no matter with who you are at work, at school, or at home. The last reason is that people often excuse their lies by saying that they protect other people from being hurt. This is simply because people do not try to be diplomatic enough to deliver their opinions. I am a strong believer that being a good communicator is a caring behavior to others. In summary, for these reasons, I maintain that although we need to pay a lot of attention how to maintain good trust and relationship with others, we should be honest as much as possible.

The spring season is the most important part to start your new year because it gives you the energy you need after long wintertime. It fills you up with the energy you will need for the upcoming rest of the year. To obtain energy from the sun, I usually spend my free time in the garden which is good advice for many people who want to do something useful and simultaneously take off from tidy daily routines – in a roundabout kind of way. Not to mention your immune system which needs to fill up the battery as well to work properly. Secondly, the spring brings you an opportunity to set off somewhere to look around or visit a castle. My best choice is to assume this season as a start to achieve your new goals such as reduce your weight or become better in an activity you like do. If you have the possibility like me and you live near the national park, my recommendation is to try cycling or walk. As far as I am concerned, movement in the fresh air is the best start to a new season.

As far as I am concerned, my activities include cycling, running and walk. If you want to stay in good shape and condition, I would recommend changing your activity more often.

Dear town council, I heard that there are intensive discussions among the town council members about banning mobile phone usage on public transportation, in shops and restaurants. I assume advantages and disadvantages of this plan have been thoroughly evaluated by experts. In conjunction with, I would like to express my strong disagreement with this plan as a tax payer, too. To begin with, it is too drastic for people to adjust their current ways to work and manage daily activities if the ban comes into force. Communications on mobile phone have been inevitable social infrastructure for the past three decades. Without it, I think that productivity at work will be decreased, even though the ban is effective within limited areas. Another reason is that people nowadays need to reach someone as well as to be reachable whenever they need from anywhere due to security reasons. For instance, parents, who are still heading back home on a commuter train, will be relieved when they receive a call from their children at home. Another example is that children, whose aged parents live remotely, will be seriously worried about the parents’ health condition when their parents do not answer the cell phone, who might be simply eating out at that time. Having said that, I maintain the idea that appropriate phone usage should be kept for good manners in public places. My suggestion is to introduce dedicated times and dates for specified places or zones where using mobile phones triggers server punishment. I firmly believe that the idea of banning mobile phones in such areas is still not ready for the above reasons. It would be greatly appreciated if the council members would reconsider the plan. Best regards, AAAA BBBB

I want to say, I like all seasons of the year, but when the first flowers are coming out and the grass is getting a little bit more greener as it was to or three days ago.

There are many arguments why people think that is beneficial for students to have the same teacher for several years. From the other view, people believe that having a different teacher at least each year is more productive and beneficial for students. I am in two minds about that. Firstly, having the same teacher for several years gives more opportunity to know his students much better. If I take an example from my childhood, my teacher was deeply familiar with the problems I was having in my family life and how these problems contributed to my assessment at school. The communication between us has improved since the time. To be more precise, he knew how I was able to solve my tasks given by him. Last but not least, due to the fact, the teacher knew each student personally for many years, offers a variety of possibilities to deal with each other more completely. From the second argument stated above, I would like to say that having a different teacher each year reduce teacher’s chances to know his students better. In this case, solving problems with students usually put the teacher in a difficult situation because his personality would be different from what he thought about him. For example, if we do not know where the problems come from, we will usually find it difficult to give any support – in a roundabout kind of way. If I look on both sides, having the same teacher for several years seems to be the most persuasive argument. I completely agree with the statement that a teacher should have to know its students from both sides, which means personally and mentally. If there is no cooperation between a student and a teacher, we will not achieve any desired success or resolution we set before.

My favourite season of the year Everyone is unique and prefer different things and this is why every human being is special. A report that I read online said that people tend to love more the season that they're born in. But I disagree with this statement because some people prefer cold instead of warmth. Even though I was born in September , in autumn , I love summer more . My mom told me that when she went to the hospital it was so hot that you couldn't stay outside for 10 minutes without feelng dizzy,but when she got home with me it was extremely cold,the season changed within a week. So I think this is the best explanation why I love summer so much. If you couldn't tell until now , my favourite season is summer. You might think I enjoy summer this much because it is hot and sunny ,but this isn't the truth. Actually it is , but the freedom is the main reason why. Just being free and hanging out with friends or going to the pool is the real reason why I think summer is the best. Being hot and sunny is just a plus and everyone who reads this can agree with me that summer is the best season to make memories. What do you think? Which is the best season and why? Sure thing summer is mine. Kisses,Roxana.

Music is an integrant part of our life, when we listen to music we feel emotion and develop our creativity. But as part of the school is it a good thing ? In the first place I'll tell you why music as a subject is to be avoided, is the second place I'll tell you how to learn music if you want to add this subject obligatory in your school. Firstly, music is not made to be a subject, but something outside school. Usually, students listen to music on the trip to school and to their house, and after they finish their homework. So, imagine that students associate music with school, it will stop to be something relaxing. For example, if a guy really hate school but loves music, and he realise that the subject of music isn't cool in school, he can imagine that it is the same in the professional world and stop his talent. Secondly, if you absolutely want to teach music in your school, you have to make this subject attractive, and associate this class with something more fun than traditional lessons. For the same example than the first part, if this student find this subject interesting, he can search pursuite of studying in music. To conclude, use music correctly and make your student happy to come in music lessons even if they are not talented in it. Creating different workshops for each level, it will permise to interest everyone to develop their capacity.

University is really hard, for me both of these solutions have adantages and inconveniences. Living with your family have many advantages; You are helped by them and you don't have to pay the rent, the food. They are an emotional support for you. But, there are a lot of inconveniences; for example, you don't have your intimity, you can't leave and returns to the house when you want, you can't invite friends. But the worst is that they can perturbate your revisions, you can be devloved. Remind it: too much emotion equal to less stability. Living alone have more advantages; You have all your intimity, you can make choices that you want, for example you can eat when you want. You don't have to do the housework everyday because you have your organization. And finally, you have all the calm for study because no one can disturb you. But there are inconvenient too; you can feel alone sometimes, and your food isn't as good as your parents, moreover you don't have a lot of money, then you don't eat so much. You have to resolve your own problems... I prefer live alone because it develop autonomy and organization.

Volunteer work is a way for students to help an association for disabled people, or a community for example gays left in the street by their parents, or Black and Latinos people who are victims of racism... Some high schools have a requirement that students must complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In the first place I'll tell why it's really good for them but in the second place I'll tell why I think it has convenient. In the first place, makes volunteering an obligation force students to help other people and see what is going on for people who need help. They'll be more comprehensive about difficulties present in the country and they can be really useful. In the second place, I think it hasn't to be necessary. In fact, it seems good but some students do that only for university and when they are in the association, they help nobody or are unpleasant. The best way to correct this error is this one: universities should add a reccomendation letter in the folder of the student, then the association or the person concern of the student's volunteering can explain the behavior of this one.

It is often discussed if there is a right to die. Many old people rather want to die instead of staying in a bed because they are not fit anymore. As a result, they prefer a shorter, more intense life a longer and calmer one. In the following text, I shall consider two arguments why everyone should choose a shorter one. One point is you only live once. If you just spend your time with hanging around and relaxing, you will not experience something. When you are shortly before your death, it is better to say "Wow, I made many experiences and although I haven't been living for a long time, I had a valuable life" than seeing nothing, isn't it? Probably the most important argument is that a calming life cannot go along with a happy life. You should have your time to do what you like - no matter if you want to do sports, travel or go to work. Additionally, for reaching real happiness you need people you love like a family and friends. Having get to know these people, you must invest your free time for them, especially a family is very time-intensive. In conclusion, you need to invest your free time for doing things you like to get completely content. In view of the above arguments, no one should waste time and start to life. Of course, it is good to relax for getting new energy for new discoveries. But in the end, it is not the years in your life that count, it is the life in your years.

The first thing that really important for our health is hygiene. If people cannot maintain their cleanliness in their life, it will be useless. I will give my analysis. First, if you can't maintain the hygiene in your food, you will get easier to sick. People often don't feel sick in their first and second food. But, if their immune get down, people will get easier because of the unhealthy food, even though they eat some healthy foods. Second, if you do exercise with dicipline but after do exercise you don't take a bath or the place for the exercise is not clean, it just make you get sick.

Dear Sir, Dear Madam, as I read your suggestion to ban the use of mobile phones on public transport and in shops and resaurants, I was excited so I want you to know that you will have my full support. I have been living in this town for 17 years noticing how it has changed. Especially young children are only sitting in front of their smartphone while they are driving in the bus. Even more, they are rarely talking to their friends anymore. I do not like this development. Of course, sometimes I also use my smartphone while I am sitting in the bus or train if there is no one I know. If there are any acquiantances, I will definitely talk to them. Even worse it is at restaurants. My parents have already told me it is unacceptable and impolite sitting in a restaurant with a mobile phone. Usually there you are not alone, consequently there is anyone you can talk with. Despite, daily I see a growing number of families who are sitting in a restaurant using a smartphone. In conclusion, I would strictly recommend a ban of smartphones at public places. The next generations are used to having a smartphone as a replacement for conversations with acquiantances, which is unhealthy as well as unsocial. As a result, I think we should affect this development with that new law. Yours faithfully Helen Deuchar

There can be no doubt that open offices support creative thinking and ensure team-work. They even increase the working experience tremendously, so that the collaborators interact with each other, it might even be the case that critical thinking skills, as well as acumen, are enhanced if the programmers have an open designed office. However, single-person offices are proven to be more effective, as a result of the fact that there is little to no disturbance. The workers can put their entire focus on the project and it would necessitate that they have to work because there is nobody to converse with. Nevertheless, people need changes and differences, so that a completely entrepreneurial office design might be an egregious expectorate. All over the world companies take advantage of similar office designs, especially multinational corporations promulgate their creative methods to design offices. Most of them are of the complexion that creative tasks are the significant ones, nowadays. Formerly, companies deemed green spaces and other free-time activities in their office complexes as needless. However, it is a fact that green spaces additionally support creative parts of the mind, so that workers are even more effective.

The question to rather stay home or pay rent whilst visiting a university, so that students are independent of their parents necessitates being answered by every individual student. Fraternities are a unique opportunity to make friends and make studying fun. It is not only about studying itself, strictly speaking, but the whole experience is also marvelous. Nobody describes your actions and you can do whatever you want. This might transpire to be more difficult than expected.

A few months ago I have discovered a useful tool for writing in the English language called „Write and Improve“. However, but it is not the only tool I use to improve my writing. As a second tool, I use „Grammarly“. Each tool scores its writers according to different ways of the settings they did before writing. If I can make a recommendation, I would say both of them have advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, the tool Write and Improve is sectioned in four levels of progress from the beginner to advanced. A result of your hard work is awarded. The function of each award is your support to start a new writing task to reach the next award. Besides, the tool offers services like checking your writing by a teacher or participation in a class where you can provide your advice to other students. Simultaneously, you can share the task you created for others. Secondly, the tool Grammarly does not offer creating writing tasks or to answer them. This tool is completely different from Write an Improve. It can only check your writing and it offers you a correction of your mistakes. To use this tool more effectively is to make a setting for your writing goals. All things considered, as a result of my recommendation I would say the tool Write and Improve is much more useful for students of English at different levels. Conversely, Grammarly seems to be the most useful tool for those who use English in their work. For example, to write a business letter or write an essay on a topic you want.

Also many teenagers prefer spent a lot of time playing video games instead of studying or in worst case these video game can to provoke a violent behavior in the lives of children. I think that is responsibility of parents take care about their children's' activities and prevent bad behaviour. Likewise motivate to teenagers to do sports activities and teach to recognize when a video game can influence negatively.

Video games regroup a lot of category, some of them are considered like good, others are considered like bad. In the first place, I'll explain the good parts of video games. In the second place, I'll explain the bad parts of video games. In the first place, video games can be a good way for children for education, for example you can find mathematics, language or science games on smartphone, "Wii..." In the second place, video games can have a bad influence on children, but it is parents role to control on what their children play. For example you can forbide war games and games with violence, sex... To conclude with my opinion about the subject of influence of video games, I think that children who have a problem of violence, less study, bad organization... have to be educated, video games or not a children who is violent will stay with the same attitude. Parents can let their children play with video games but they have to educate and limit their activities in order to make a cohesion between autonomy and rules.

Does it improve the student's awareness of the post-school time, if they do volunteer work? By working, students have the opportunity to experience different types of tasks and might figure out what they want to work in after they have graduated. The ideal would be, if they find a certain job they like, so that they can study the required subject and always have a delightful motivation, due to the reason that the students already know how inspiring the time after university will be. Volunteer work is proven to help students to enhance their social skills. For example, if the students do babysitting they are not only doing it for the parents but themselves. The requisite abilities, you need in order to handle the infants appropriate, are also necessary for most jobs. Furthermore, it embellishes your CV. In the beginning, you might overwork yourself and thing that you are not designed for hard work. However, that is simply a way to ameliorate your way of thought, because you sometimes have to take the rough with the smooth. And if you are smarter afterward, volunteer work is definitely a worthwhile occupation. Nevertheless, some students might have a different take on the topic and consider it wasted time. Students are convinced of the assertion that spending time with their friends, is more important. Moreover, extra-curricular activities, which are mostly of a sportive kind are a way to improve your body as well. Taking all those aspects into consideration, volunteer work is a worthwhile occupation and it will do everything but bad to your mind, or your body. In my opinion, it should not replace sports activities but work as an addition to your high school time-table.

The phone is very useful for guide us everywhere where we want. Furthermore, we have the possibility to be connected at internet and allow us to keep informed about all around us. Secondly, This is something very useful in case of threat. For instance, if somebody has a problem in the public transport or anywhere, they can call to the police in order to stop the problem. Or, another reason if, there is a fire somewhere, call to firemen is a good thing. Thirdly, keep the use of mobile in any cicumstances allow the person to be always be refined anywhere and anytime, there was kidnappings long time ago.

Studying abroad is the fact to study in another country for a time during high school or university. In the first place we will see the advantages of this practice and in the seconde time we will see the disadvantages of this practice. I will take the examples of the USA and France. In the first place, studying abroad have some advantages. Firstly, the learning of a second language will represent you as a billingual individual on your CV for example because actually, the acknowledgment of English is necessary in the world. Secondly, as an international student you will have more opportunities after university because you can find a job in two country and choose where you can have more money, where do you want to live... For example, employees are better paid in the USA than in France. But, in the second place there are disadvantages to study in another country. Firstly, there are different way of life, habits and culture between United States of America and France for example. Secondly, we can make a comparison between university in two different countries, one where it is free like in France, and one where it is really expensive like in the USA. It is an example of what sacrifices you can have to do for study in another country. To finish, studying abroad can be a really good experience but necessite to have a project.

One of the less important subjects in schools is music, which plays a key role to wake up students emotions and learn them to think much deeper - in a roundabout kind of way. What is more, the music helps to understand things around us and finally, it boosts your brain activity. To put it in another way, schools trying to find talents throughout this method of learning. However, there are different approach from schools in the learning of music. Approximately 35 per cent of schools required playing a musical instrument as well. To be more precise, all students in the class have to play a musical instrument. Conversely, the rest of the schools do not require playing a musical instrument on its students. A good illustration of this is in primary schools, where their students are prepared for a higher level of education such as in University or High school. From the arguments stated above, I see a reason to give students a choice, whether they want to learn music and simultaneously play a musical instrument or not. If I were in the position of the director of a school, I would have given them a choice. From my view, playing a musical instrument should be optional and studying music should be considered only for students up to third class in primary schools.

To put it simply, live on your own has its advantages and disadvantages as well as live with your family. There's a lot to take in of what each group of students preferring while studying at university. So, let's unpack closely both groups of students to uncover it. While the first group of students whose choice was to live on their own depending on a budget to live. A good illustration of this is to pay for the rent of the household they live in. What is more, this includes approximately 40 per cent of their income. Simultaneously, there are other payments you need to think about before you decide on how you deal with your money. By and large, your monthly income must cover all needs of your life such as travel to school, food, household. Conversely, those who decided to stay with their families while studying do not need to prioritize their budget as those who live on their own. This means in a practical term that you do not pay for all necessaries of daily life. However, the contribution is expected in some cases. Furthermore, the disadvantage of staying with your family would shorten your time to study in comparison to others.

Holidays are of immeasurable importance to students. It gives them the unique opportunity to retrospect the past year, in addition to that they can contemplate their future and think about their oncoming life. In the case that you have the possibility to drive or even fly somewhere beautiful, you might have an unforgettable time. This was the case two years ago when I went to Bali. At this time my uncle lived in Singapore and we gave him a flying visit, on our way to Bali. I have not seen much of the city considering the fact that we were there just for two days, but we saw the famous flower garden, as well as all the zillion ships, approaching at the harbor. What kept in my head the most was all that smog, it seemed like clouds with the exception that they were dark gray and the humidity in the air was devastating. There can be no doubt that these conditions are detrimental to your health. Seeing this has quite a different effect on you and for my way of thinking it was of crucial importance to see such an event out of the vicinity. Despite it was not a beautiful event it was the most inspiring holiday I ever had. I will never forget it. Additionally, it was the longest distance I ever traveled, just to see this calamity. It was incredible.

Thie aim of the following review is to analyse the impact of Write and Improve's page on the student's learning progress. Let's dive into the topic starting from the visual impact of the page. What stands out is a perfectly balanced page. The choice of light colors (with hints of black ink here and there), makes it easier to navigate among tasks and assignments. Each category contains a selection of activities dedicated to all learners, from elementary to advanced. Each category includes a whole plethora of topics raging from esseys to snackable articles, and letters to choose from. I think the page is a game changer, a quantum leap forward, as it has prominently revolutionized the way we approach writing in English. No more loads of money spent on pricey private teachers. No more issues with timings and schedules. Not only is the service custom tailored and available 24 hours a day, but it also gives you a feedback in a blink of an eye. What I find less appealing though, relates to its useage on mobile phones, which I find slightly old style and uncomfortable. Secondly, the automatic approach to all sort of human expression in the realm of literature, may result in shallowness and emptiness. In conclusion, I recommend students to use it as a secondary tool.

I think studying aboard is better than local studying for many reasons. The normal person who study in their country they have a lot of assistance thing because available transport and they are in the same culture same people and everything is easy to them so they can't have a feeling of responsibility and independence.

I live in a rural area, it's a small town and there'sn't many medical attention, there are only two doctors and the only pharmacy there'sn't enough medicine. Here people is very poor and can't pay for a good medical attention, but hire not is the only place with a low resources. In Mexico the 85% the of population suffer ecomonic problems but that's not the most disappointed, the really worrying is that the medical attention that the government bring to his society is very limited. The most of the doctors in Mexico find to work in a job that allows them have a good economic level and that is achieved by working in the city and not in the rural areas. The reason for this problem is that the government doesn't pay a living wage so that there are enough doctors and medical attention in the areas of greatest need. I think that if the corresponding authorety focuses on build more health centers and hire more doctors with a good salary perhaps they would enjoy work in these places.

In some schools is an obligations to take music class and learn to play a musical instriment, I'm not totally agree in this option, I think that learn Music is about felings, passion, love and dedicatio and not by obligations and duty.

I don't have a lot free time, but when I have it, I like reading, cooking and go hiking. Reading is the activity that I do most, because it doesn't n't need much, but cooking and hiking are activities that require more time and resources, so I do these activities at least once a month. I like all these activities because they make me feel free, to make me feel strong and to allow me know new places, real or fantastic places. Actually, yesterday I submerged to a new exotic and fantastic place during my reading.

In my view every child should play the proper video game for his age. You can't give to a child an 18+ game. Also, I think that such video games like shooting or fighting is not appropriate for children at any age. I know cases where the child grown to be a violent person and that put him even in prison. I really think that a child should play video games which will help him to evolve and become a better person. As a second view too much video games affects anyone. After a long perios you wouldn't be able to see straight and your health will be also affected. I would end with my strongly opinion that in childhood every parent must educate his child to spend more time socializing in real life, to play, to evolve and to study, not to play video games all day in the house.

In my view zoos are places for people to see how do wild animals look in reality. When I was at any zoo the first ideea that went into my mind was to see a real tiger or a real monkey, not to learn abaout how they live or feed. But if put it like that, from zoos you can learn a lot of things about animals, if you read the boards. Also, you can read about how wild animals live, and feed from the internet, it's not necessary to kep some animals in captivity to learn about them. The way I see it, zoos don't keep animals in captivity to learn moer abaout them. The animals are kept in captivity for money. If the people wouldn't be interested to see the animals in flesh and bones, they wouldn't bee kept in captivity. All this debate about zoos and wild animals it resumes to money.

The way I see it, if in your country you can't get a properly education then the best thing to do is to study abroad. In Romania the best thing to do, based on the domain you want to study, is to go in another country like England or Belgium. From my side, even in high school you can study in another country is you have some relatives there. If you don't have someone there, then is quite dangerous because you can lose yourself. In university you are older and the probability to lose youserlf is smaller. Also in other countries you can study less and better. England is in this case the best country for a good faculty. If I have to compare, in Romania you are studying seven subjects in one semester but in England you have to study four subjects in each semester. So, to end this discussion, if your country has a poor education system, than you must update your alternatives.

I am writing to apologize to you for that I did not reply immediately to your letter. However, I was on holiday for three weeks with my new girlfriend. You asked me in your last letter about a review of a movie I love the most. Well, the film was written by well-known filmmaker Clint Eastwood. The movie is called the Letters from Iwo Gima. It is about ordinary men who were sent to fight in a none sense war. On one side, many of them died on the battlefield. On the other side, lots of them committed suicide. The key point of the story is, before they died, everyone wrote letters to their family members, relatives or loved once. These letters had never been sent off. Instead, they have been hidden in the caves on the island and found after 50 years. Clint Eastwood wrote the movie based on those letters. It is a real story that makes you feel whit those soldiers who died in a terrible war. I do hope you will be amazed by the story and reality that comes from the letters. We can not imagine that in a real situation.

Last summer I spent my holiday in Tenerife. I was the best holiday I had until now. I stayed at Udalla Park hotel. It was at ten minutes to the Playa de la Americas, the best beach from Tenerife. We visited all the top 10 attractions from Tenerife. From the first day on the island we had our visiting schedule fixed. In the first four days we visited Loro Park which is the best park I have ever seen, Monkey Park where we played with animals like monkeys or lisards, Mount Teide which had a great view and Siam Park, the best aquapark in the world. Most of our time we spent visiting all the parts from the island. We rented a car and we drove on all the roads from the island. It was the best holday I have ever had because besides the great beaches we had a lot of touristic points to visit and we spent a lot of time driving around the island.

I have to admit I am a bit surprised by your letter. A birthday celebrating in your country seems to be a bit boring. People usually celebrate their birthday differently and strangely in our country. We are the nation of improvisations. However, a birthday is not an exception. To give an illustration, I celebrated my last birthday at the campsite with my best friends from work.

Not to mention, you are the only person to say how to celebrate your birthday.

I think it depends on teachers. If the teachers are fit for me, I want to learn from them for a long time. In this case, I can understand what they teach smoothly and I feel that my ability has been progressing. On the other hand, I want to have new teachers if I feel that current teachers are not good for me. By changing to new teachers, I may understand well and I feel that his class is enjoyable. To change to new teachers also have a chance to get a new thinking. As a result, I think about my future and have a clear image in my future. In summary, changing to new teachers has a positive aspect and a negative aspect in each. Therefore, I don't insist on one aspect and I think I should choose best one when I choose teachers.

Second: even with a weak teacher you will be able to self-learning specifically within the Internet which is brought up a major revolution in the self-learning field and I always say to my students they can replace any teacher in their school with the Internet where there is a countless website to learn any material you want whether on Youtube or any learning platform in various fields. Learning from only one teacher makes the student passive in his learning and limits his ability to learn from a variety of sources Finally: Perhaps in primary school the children's students need one teacher in order to the strong establish in learning reading and writing basics.

I was playing video games in my teenage specifically PlayStation one and it was a very exciting at that time and also there was a conflict with my mother because we were playing more than four hours daily and she was so angry with us, so I understand the concerns of parents about children behavior with video games by the addiction on it and urge their sons to balance in their life. Video games are so attractive to play and for me, I see it as a personal experience where affect to son of them negatively via spending many hours on it and that kind of play lead to defect in balance and severe weakness in social communication and lack of concentration. On the other hand, maybe video games grow programming skills and perhaps be in it benefit financial and therefore become a profession and source of income. Now video games became an industry that loves it wide supporters around the world so parents have to deal with it more realistically and try to be close with their sons in order to limit to negative effects and support their hobbies without collision.

About keeping animals in zoos, I don't think it's really good because animals belong to the nature and if you need to learn something about animals you can just read some specific books or search the information on the internet, or seeing some TV programmes about them. But it's true too that zoos are pretty good for basic information about animals like their living zone or the food they eat seen with your eyes but they should be in the countryside. I just think that animals belong in nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos,because they aren't living good at the zoos as in their habitat. See polar bears as an example, they can't live good at the zoos because they are from Antartic or some near places but not in the zoos that are in cities. And there are a lot of animals that doesn't eat as good as in their habitat because there isn't the food they eat.

Write and Improve represents a great way to update your English skills. It helps even you vocabulary. The best thing to do is to have a daily schedule to follow. You can write at least 30 rows a day. One of the best thing is to write a lot because when you are writing, you are studyying how to express yourself and you are searching for new words and phrases. Write and Improve has his good points but it also has his weaknesses. You can spend too much time on the writing part and neglect the speaking, listening or grammar parts. With writing you can improve a lot your English but if you exaggerate, you can spend too much on it and damage the other parts of English. Writing is important but don't forget about speaking, listening, reading and the grammar parts.

From my view the same teacher is good when you are in elementary school because you need a teacher and a role model. You need that teacher for at least 4 years. The teacher have to know you and your parents and why not even your hobbies. He must teach you how to become responsible and how to take life in your own hands. A different teacher also helps you a lot, because you get to know different views of life and different personalities. From every human being you can learn something good or bad. You can make a selection of your learning from all your teachers. To summarise if you have the same teacher you can have a good role model and a good second parent but if you will have many different teachers, you will learn what diversity means and a lot of new visiona about life .

In 2006 launched the government of Saudi the king Abdullah program for the scholarship to study bachelor and master and doctorate, so that programme made a lot of students in Saudi front golden opportunity abroad for the study where the conditions were very easy to study in the United state or United kingdom or some countries. This program was a qualitative leap to education progress in Saudi and now there are thousands of graduates came back after end their studying, so I see it as a great advantage for any student if he can study abroad specifically in scientific sections and economy or management. The advantages of studying abroad are many like learning a new language and identify new cultures and communities and increase self-confidence and independence. Concerning disadvantages perhaps some students suffer their distance from the family, therefore, feel to depression and isolation leading to affect negatively on their studying.

I just think that in the school of the future, the master classes will disappear and the teacher will no longer act only as a transmitter of knowledge, but will have as its main mission to guide the student through their own learning process. The curriculum will be personalized to the needs of each student and personal and practical skills will be valued more than academic content. The Internet will be the main source of knowledge, even more than the school, and English will be consolidated as the global language of teaching. Education will be more expensive and last a lifetime. The families without access to an education would start dissappearing and even most of the families would have a better education for their kids or even adults. But, there will continue being a danger place for the smaller kids.

In the future I think that college will be done on the internet. From my view college is optional, so you can have some courses online and you can spare the time of going to the class. In high school or lower, you need a good teacher, the student is not prepared to study by himself, so only in collage I think it will be great for future to implement a study from home college. Another thing that will appear in the school will be the new subjects to study because the old ones are oudated. In the digital era we need the children to learn fast and only the useful parts not the ones which will never be used. From my view, the old type of learning, by books, will still be used because I can't see a future without books.

Unhealthy lifestyle has began to influence the life of the students both at university and school. One of them is inactive lifestyle. It indeed brings severe impacts on the students' lifestyle. Several efforts have been proposed as one of them is forcing them to do sports activities at least 3 three times in a week. However, would it create such an impact? First of all, doing exercise is beneficial for the body as it can bring positivies to the students and improve them physically and mentally. However, bear in mind that every student has its own right for its own body. They can do whatever they want with their bodies as they can choose whichever lifestyle they are going to implement as the responsibilities are on them. Forcing them contradicts to their rights of their body autonomy. Therefore, Encouraging them to do sports would be better than making it mandatory. Second of all, healthy lifestyle is not all about physical activities such as do sports or exercise. Doing sports is not the only one in order to have a healthy life. There are many other activities that can have the students to reach healthy life such as diet, food choices or meditations. Therefore, sports activities are not the only actions school can take but educating them to be healthy is also one the solutions. Third of all, it is irrelevant to force the students to do sports three times a week. The healthy lifestyle is not defined by quantity of exercises in a week done by a person. But it is more to the quality of the exercise. It would be less relevant to have exercise for three times in a week without having a good quality of activities than just once with impacts to the students. Besides, the students are generally busy with their own courseworks and extracurricular activities as it becomes a hindrance for them to do exercise if it is being upheld. In conclusion, forcing students to do sports every week might bring good impact on them. However, it contradics to their rights and potentially impedes their activities. Encouraging them to do exercise is actually more preferred than making it compulsory.

In one way television is a good thing. With television we can educate children and even grown ups. For children we can have some educational shows like maths, chemestry or even physics. We can concentrate even on climate change and try to educate people from a young age to be responsible and to recycle. The most important televizion shows must be on education. In another way we must have some entertaining in television like comedy, drama, horror or action. Television is about entertaining people, we must show to all the world that it's worth it to watch TV and if we are good in commercial we can even convince them that it's a must. To sum all of this I must add the fact that health is also important and we must exercise, so 24 hour of TV won't help us in this matter.

Hello teacher, As today we had a class discussion about healthy life, I realize that doing exercise is necessary to have a healthy life, but even at that point, there are more important things than healthy life, like family, friends and more... But, without a healthy life you couldn't live that much to appreciate those points that I wrote before. So what I'm thinking is... Healthy live is pretty good, but even in the good moments of that life, it could let you fall and may make you start again from all way up. As you probably know, there are very addicting things, like biscuits or other kind of sweets that could make you lose you healthy life work progress that aren't that bad, but I just really think that having stops for eating some sweets aren't bad, I mean, if you have a healthy life and you think that you'll like some sweets but you are scared about falling down that effort, don't worry, just eat them in a very small quantities.... Get rekt teacher.

Personally, I think that both health and money are important bunt in different but to be healthy is more important because you can make a lot of money if you are healthy but is you have problems then you have to spend money for your health and to make things worse, you can't work as you used to. I am sure that if you have a good health status, the money will come by hard work, but if you are ill then you will have problems with both. If we want to discuss the money subject, we must admit that money helps you to keep healthy because you must go annually at doctors and you must spend some money on the health care. Money also helps us to have a good education. Let's admit it, everyone needs money to study at a good school. To summarise all, you need money to keep your health and education at higher standards and you need health to produce money.

Dear Sir/Madam! I have a distinct pleasure to write this letter with the intent of expressing my candid insight into the ban on mobile phones on public transportation and public places. My life experience enabled me to conclude that material possessions offer temporary solace; due to my perseverance in self-improvement and investment in my education. I broadened my perspective to the point of being able to shift dramatically from materialistic to spiritual. This spiritual awakening enabled me to become successful in determining the right and wrong aspects of human activity. Never have I been more convinced of the detrimental effects of mobile phones on human well-being than in current reality, when our society is facing the unprecedented spike in mental health issues, single-person households, divorce rates, addictions, broken homes, and suicide rates, not to mention security concerns related to mental exhaustion that prompts hazardous behaviors in humans. Moreover, a national inquiry into effects of mobile phones on toddlers aged one to three years old carried out in 2006 by the National Institute of Science reveals that pupils engaged in online activity for more than two hours a day demonstrate shorter brain wawes compared to their counterparts who were not exposed to such stimulation. Additionally, the first group reports a considerable increase in self-esteem and academic achievement. For this reason, I urge you to implement the prohibition on mobile devices in public facilities. Should any additional detail be required, I would be delighted to provide more information backed by in-depth scientific insights to support my theory. Yours faithfully Maddalena

About having different teachers every year, I'm thinking than having a new teacher is better than having the same teacher for many years, that's because having the same teacher every year could make the students want to stop with the school, because most of them want a new teacher every year or if it cannot be a new one, one teacher that they had, but, not repeat the same teacher and that's even more boring than trying a new teacher every year because if they have the same teacher every year, the students could do some tricks to the teacher, as I know most of the students would try to look better to a new teacher because.. It's new. Even with the same teacher they could look better to the teacher but that's stranger to happen.

Is learning to speak a foreign language as important these days as it was in the past? Well, yes it is, as in these days, knowing a foreign language is one of the most important things that you need, because without it, you cannot do such things as if you know a language, for example, for travelling it's easier to speak clearer with someone in a restaurant, an hotel, or even in your own house. As in the past a foreign language were less studied, travelling to another country was one of the most difficult things and people most got stuck in its country because they didn't know how to speak another language. So, I really think that is important to speak a foreign language. SO traveling or getting a job would be a lot easier, and even with the foreign language, you can teach people.

As in this ztker question, I really think that studying in other country depends on your English level, (not always need to be English but it's most common yes) because if you don't know that foreign language English could save you, but schools, schools, could be a very different things, for example. If you explode you die you know?.

My reason for learning English is the job and everything. I must be a good English speaker if I wnat to have a good paid job and if I want to have a good and a fluent discussion in another country. The way I see it, if you want a good paid job you must know 2 or event 3 foreign languages, English has become mandatory. In some countries if you want to work as a cashier, you must know English so English is something that the employee expects you to have from your birth. In the future I think that English will be an important subject la math or something like that. In some buisnesses from Romania you can speak English and everithyng will be fine. You don't have to speak good Romanian. In the end you must learn English.

I’m writing to you to inform a university life. When we discuss the school life, it’s difficult to answer a question below. Which university do you think is better for you to choose, the one far away or the one near you? I think there are strong points and weak points for each other. Firstly, I explain about when students live in a remote location to go to a university. By living there, they have to do various kinds of tasks by themselves. As a result, they will change their mind and they can prepare to become full-fledged members of society. On the other hand, their parents have to have a certain burden more money. Secondly, I’d like to have any opinions about when students live in their family's house. They have more free time than the students who live in remote place, because their parents’ support dairy housework. Moreover, there is no need about extra living fee by staying with their own family. Therefore, they don’t need to work hard to support family budget. As a result, they can have more experiences for them. They will affect their future life. When I went to university, I lived in a remote place. I could change my mind by doing by myself. Both have a strong point and a weak point, but I recommend former one in the view of my experience.

I think that when you get used to someone or someplace, you feel too comfortable and you run the risk of being reckless. But when you´re facing new paths or things, you are forced to be alert and you´ll problably think that you have to show your best to make the best impression of yourself. So, if you´re having lessons with the same teacher for a long time, the comfort that this brings to you, won´t challenge you to surprise him, because you already know each other. He already knows what you´re good at and in which areas you need improvements. Looking at this way, it is an advantage because he can work on your flaws and just ensure your qualities. The new teacher is going to spend more time with you to get to know before he can do what your last teacher was doing. But if teachers communicate with each other and share knowledge, this time of recognition could be decreased.

I guess that like any other activity, there has to be boundaries. And those boundaries have to be given to children by their parents. Too much video game could be harmful for their sight, could jeopardize their studies, their grades at school and it is not good for their healthy. It´s because doctors do not recommend for our bodies to stay in the same position for so many hours. So, I think that playing video game can be a hobby and like any other hobby it couldn´t take of you many hours in the day. They should play video games only if they´ve already done their homework, if they´ve already studied and if they´ve already done their list of must do chores of the day. There are other things that should be considered. There are games too violent that could affect children´s mind. So, the parents should be aware of that too and, from the time to time , they should just take a fast look on their children´s games.

I think that studying abroad can give you lots of great experiences and could also make you more independent. But I think that the most advantage is the opportunity of knowing yourself far away from the look of your parents, family and friends. It gives you the freedom of discovering sides of you that you didn´t know of. Some of them you will enjoy and some of them you won´t, but you can work on those that you didn´t like and make a better version of yourself. But there will be also the feeling of loneliness, especially in the first months. The knowdledge among with it adventure is also a huge experience. The school´s structure and the educational system will be different from what you were used to and you will have to adjuste yourself in this whole new world. The school´s colleagues will be probably from different countries. So, the challenge of living together with people from different countries gives the opportunity of facing different opinions, cultures and habits. This will give personal and professional growth. There is also the big opportunity of being fluent in a new language. This will improve your resumé and you will be a footstep ahead on the journey of finding a job.

For me it is very important have an enjoyable place to work, in many office job the employees have cubicles and don't have the freedom to develop theirs skills. I think that is necessary have our own place to think and discovery news ideas to the company, but is important too that the boss always know what doing their employees while they are working. When the employees are in his work usually spend their time with their co-workers tallking about their life and problems until some things that is good for the employers. When you are in a job where you can tallk with your co-workers, you are more comfortable and your performance is higher. For that I would like recommande and motivate to all businessmen that take care of their employees and have a warm and creative place, with this energy all workers will be able to be more efficient.

About television, In my opinion, television is most of the times good, but it can make a person who really likes a program stay a lot with the TV, and that's bad, there are a lot of series that makes small children act like if they were in a show, because many kids that aren't knowing what are they doing, they act like in a reality show , most of the time it isn't bad but there are sometimes that it can be bad, but there are many programs that 'educate' or well, they try it, as an example, if we have to be a lot of time at home without going to school and you can't do videocalls with teachers, those programs does the work, but if you're in an age of more than 8 years old, it doesn't do the work very good, because it shows things that with that age, you may know.

In my opinions, books should continue in libraries, schools, universities...

If I had to do a retrospective of my educational growth, I would say that I´m at a higher level on the following areas: mathematics, physics and chemistry. This is definitely because those are the subjects that I´m pleased with and because of it I spend more time studying them. I think it´s because I like to read the theory and then exercise what I´ve learned. Furthermore, I enjoy the objectivity that it comes with those subjects. So, for this year I just intend to keep following the same schedule and commitment that I did last year with those subjects. On the other hand, I didn´t spend enough time on studying the subjects that I don´t like as geography, history and biology. In this year, I have to try harder and spend at least 20 minutes per day for each subject. When I start studying them, I get really grumpy and this makes me give up. So, I intend to start the daily routine with a subject that I like, so that my mood and energy could increase enough for studying those which I don´t like. I hope that this will end up being a good strategy.

Health is the life´s fuel, in other words, health is what keeps you alive. So, the trick is finding a way to be healthier. That said, one of the most popular paths to reach healthiness is through exercise. But, most people forget that the exercise needs to come along with a healthy food as well. Furthermore, there is another thing which is forgotten and it plays an important rule on our life: our mind. So, even though the exercise is important to make our bodies stronger, the exercise itself is not enough. If your mind is not healthy, it won´t be able to establish a good connection with your body and so the exercise won´t provide to you all the benefits that it has. Therefore, the most important thing in life, from mine point of view, is being able to build up a healthy mind and body. If you are able to keep it, you will have time and strength to chase other things like success, happiness and goals.

The learning process can be jeopardize by a virtuallity educational way, just as the relationship between students and teachers. The pandemic came to ensure that this is entirely true. Then, in the future, teachers and students will still have to go to an educational building. However, theories and knowledge will be given to students in a completely different way. The technology will play an important part on the learning path transforming it onto a more interesting option for all. The three-dimension can be an extraordinary tool for subjects like art or history and, therefore, students will be able to experience tours at hundreds of museums at many different countries without leaving the classroom. It can also be added to biology. Mechanical animals, built by the latest technology, have a striking resemblance to the real ones. And through a hidden camera put into their bodies, they can be insert onto a natural habitat and transmit videos to a computer.

Television is often used as an entertainment tool, but it can also provides society culture and knowledge in different fields and through an easier and more interesting way. For example, there are already cartoons which adds educational cadres into their normally sequence or educational statements to their characters. These has been a good critique from parents whom have been watching his children learning about numbers, colours, animals, new vocabulary and so many other things. There are channels which are only committed to an interesting subject such as history, animals or technology. They provide plenty of documentaries, videos and discussions about the most diverse topics. These can offer sometimes extra information for those who were already familiar with the subject or can be an introduction for those who didn´t know anything about it. When it comes to a visual and hearing information, sometimes the brain captures and keeps it more easily. The really question is if the person is willing to spend his time on this type of channels.

Life is a precious gift given to us by God. Life span of any human being is unpredictable. Some people live a long life while others enjoy a short span in this world. It is a great experience to lead a long life, but I believe quantity of life should have less weightage than the quality of time spent. It is undoubtedly true, people who are living their life to the fullest are the happiest. Also, they are not dependent on others for financial or physical support in their lifetime. Firstly, it is important to be happy and healthy throughout life. People who have less expectations, like a long life will try to live the time intensely following their dreams and experiencing happiness. For instance, going for vacations and travelling around the world frequetly in younger age present the feeling of excitement and energy in life, which can prove to be a stress buster and make a person happy. Secondly, living a short and fulfilling life gives the feeling of satisfied life. It is always encouraging to have a life which is not dependent on anyone else either financially or physically. To illustrate, human body starts deteriorating after a certain age and thus, needs support for performing day to day activities, the person also becomes incapable of earning and is interdependent, which can inculcate the sense of loneliness in life. In conclusion, it is like two swords in a case. People living a long life can earn many relationships and experience the change in generations throughout their life span, whereas the one with short and lively life can live his/her life independently to the fullest. Therefore, it is in my opinion that shorter and fulfilling life is better than a calm long life.

But if you are not sleepy and someone make you sleep,no matter how dark and quiet your sleeping place is,you will still be hard to fall asleep. lf you have trouble falling asleep every night,try this:took out two dimes,when you go to sleep,place the two dimes on your eye lap,the dime can help you fall asleep. But it has some major problems too. Like you can't use this method when you're sleeping sideways. So l don't really recommend you to do it. But if you really need it,you can only sleep with your face facing up at the ceiling.

In order to understand about life, human have created different methods to keep and study several organisms from microbial culture plates to zoos. Zoos are not only to help to understand how several animals behave but to help to keep in safe animals in danger by hunting or because their habitats have been destroyed, besides in many of zoos, environmental conditions are so close similar to wild environment stimulating animals to reproduce and keeping the breed away from danger to reach the adequate age to putting them in wild habitats. At the same time, zoos have been a good way to show to people, the woth and importance of nature and they have brought all ecosistems and wild life in a little space and to have allow being close and aware to different life forms . However, many zoos do not have space and resources enough to offer a good life to all animals. Some animals have shown behaveorial disorders by locking, like elephants and gorilas. So, I think humanity should get strive to preserve natural spaces where animales live and trying to make people aware to natural conservation and it impact on their lives.

In My Opinion, No, not everyone should study music because a lot of reason one of them it is not every culture accept music like Muslims countries because music is prohibited in Islam so Muslims do not listen to music or make it or even teach it because previous reason. No one can ignore the benefits of studying music because it is very useful for mental health and we live in a world that does not care about our soul or our mentality just money and everything is money and that returns damage to our health. Music is the food of our souls the soft power of us it's our energy so we need to make our effort to declare it to all people on this planet and maybe to another planet why not?

Children love video games and while some parents think that they may have positive results on their children, some others judge them in a negative way. In my opinion, there is always good and bad in everything, maybe not in equal parts but still. Nowadays children quite no longer play outside in the playground. Forced by situation, video games may be one of the fewest opportunities for children to play and do it with others. Obviously, children tend to spend lots of time with computer games, therefore parents are required to watch over them and be the time-keeper. If children are allowed to spend a certain time-frame to play and if parents check carefully what their children play, video games are not that bad. Children can learn strategy as well as team working and last but not least they can easily learn English since most of the video games are released in English. As far as I can say, I am pro video games, as long as children are not left alone and unguarded. In such a case, video games can do more harm than any other games. Again, from my personal experience, I can state that video games for children can help them study and learn in a different way.

This it's a very controversial theme because for me tell always the truth is very imporatnt but in some cases it's important to say any lies. I think that it's a matter of perspective, there are many sitiations in the cotidian life where you have to say lies to can resolve the problem or can achieve some things. Currently the lies has become part of our life and behaviors and it's almost impossible not say any lie however insignificant it may be. I considered myself like an honest person and for me tell the truth in any moment it's very important and necessary for my values but I had to tell lies in many situatios too and not for that reason I think that I'm a bad person. For example: If in a work interview somebody ask me about my skills and my experience in the area for which I'm applying, I must tell the truth, even if I want to get the job, it's necessary to tell the truth to the interviewer because won't be honest from my part say lies to get the job. Another example where may be to tell a lie it's necessary, if my mother ask me to go to the super marked to buy food and vegetables and I forgot buy the potatoes I have to tell her that in the supermark there weren't none of the ones of she buys to cook, so, that lie no affect nothing and not for that I'll consider like a liar.

Studying abroad is a great opportunity and incredible experience. However, every student who want to study in another country for a while, should consider many aspects before decide take this opportunity. The student should have clear, why he wants to do it and if he really is ready to such experience. Sometimes, the objective of studying abroad is not clear and students only think it is a journey to know another country, but he is there as student, not as tourist, so many difficulties come up which can make his time there hard. Besides, some students are not conscious about such a huge responsabilty to study abroad with themselves and with all people who support them, because students in another country represent their university, culture and country. On the other hand, when the student decides studying abroad after thinking all responasbilities, costs, difficulties and possible bad or good experiences, he is ready to really enjoy that opportunity as student. Studying abroad experience can be so gratifying and educational experience like no other, but it also can be sometimes awkward, complicated and lonely. If the student really wants to go out his comfortable zone and he is ready to face different situations then, he should take that unique chance of studying abroad.

It was about 10 years ago. I was a teenager going through an important period of self-knowledge and acceptance of my flaws. I was starting to feeling more like a woman than like a child, but I was so insecure about my physical atributes. I didn´t feel beautiful mostly because of my skin and my lean body. I thought that I didn´t drew attention of the good looking guys and I was too bashful to make the first move. During that time, me and my family went on a vacation to a breathtaking hotel. Right there I felt so connected with nature and I must say that with myself as well. I caught the interest of three gorgeous guys and although I didn´t have anything with them, not even a kiss, it was really important for my self-esteem. I got out of there a new girl ready to embrace my new version or just my old one. It means that I was finally certain that I didn´t need anyone to tell me about my beauty. What it really matters is what I feel inside even though this sounds so cliché.

My favourite season of the year is summer. I think it is the best because the weather is nice and you can go to the beach and swim. I can swim with my friends and even my family. In the summer I like to drink a very cold cola. I like to eat ice cream. I like the summer because I do not have to wear winter clothes and I feel comfortable without it. The best reason why I like summer is that we do not have school. For me and other people summer is like a break from studying and I can rest and be ready for the next year. In the summer it is always holiday. That means that I can travel a lot to other countries and have fun there. I am longing for the summer and I hope it comes as soon as possible.

About doing volunteer work, I'm not against it, but if I ruled a high school I wouldn't force my students to do some volunteer work because helping isn't that important (for graduation) it can grow your final mark but for example, if you try to do a volunteer job because you're forced to do it to graduate, then you can't go and then you couldn't do it and you fail because that, it would make many people anger just for that. But in other parts doing volunteer work would help to make people charismatic and with eager to help more people without the wish of a reward, and that's good. Not in all cases it goes well, but I mean, doing those work is mostly common to foment the believing in that helping could do more people happier. In conclusion I won't force students to do some volunteer work to graduate, but just to make their marks better.

l think that it's good for students that they have the same teachers and classmates every year,espeically when you're at the high grades. Now let me say why at the downtown of this....... l found out that when you have a new teacher in your class,his or her's teaches is different from your old teacher. This will cause the student to malfunction (in here,malfunction means to be confused),and eventually this student will have a bad grade in the end of the the trimester compared to the last trimester. You will probably think:Why? l will answer that for you. The teachers teaching methods are not the same,which l already mentioned before. For example,l have this friend and his scores are very good. He almost got all A+s on every subject. But lately,his scores are going down very fast just because we had a new teacher. And whenever we got a test,his scores are pretty much Cs and Bs. Now a days,people (including parents) will think that we will have more to learn when we have a new teacher every trimester. But that's actually just wrong,when they look at the grades,they will think twice about the new teacher thing. But when they caught on the next trimester,they will think that having a new teacher was still best. It just goes on and on and on. But at last,l still think that having the same teacher was the best.

Well,l think l believe and agree that putting animals in a zoo is not so good,and l am pretty sure that some people around me think and feel the same too. There's a lot of sciencists out there who think my point of view is right. Here's my proof: First,our humans are never satisfied by the things they'd done and still want to get more answers from nature. But does it made it better? No. Our planet were just getting worse and worse. One time,our dear old America had it's first human caused species wipe out. It happened at 2006 July 24th,when the last Red Tailed Do-do bird had been shot down by Arnold Plamer. Now let's first get to topic. Keeping animals from nature will lose the animals's inherent abilities. Soon,it will not survive in this world anymore. Even tigers and lions that day will be killed by just a little insect. Then people will ask:"Why?" Easy,because they'd been in locked in cages so long,they even forgot how to use their hunting skills and how to surive in this "weak die,stong live" world.

I have been suggested by my teacher to start and use Write and Improve in order to broaden my written English skills. This suggestion was perfectly on time as I was looking for a web site which could help me improving my English writings. I was actually expecting to interact with a real person in order to discuss and eventually ask for feedback, I usually feel more comfortable this way. Instead Write and Improve does not foresee a direct human interaction, despite this I can confirm that it is absolutely effective and very helpful. The web site is always available, you do not need to require any appointment, just write and submit the exercise. The comments provided are very clear. Therefore, even if you don't talk to a real teacher, the feedback received is constructive and helpful as if you were in a classroom. Based on my personal experience, I will certainy recommend Write and Improve to my classmates, should they definitely wish to improve their written English.

The first discussion that appear is the importance and the utility of the money. The money can give us stability, comfort and pleasure of conquering the most beautiful and unique material possession in the world. But beauty is a subjective matter and if you don´t have enough time to enjoy the rewards of your richness, what is the point of having the biggest bank account? It is an unquestionable truth that money can´t buy healthy because our human body has still so many mysteries to solve. There are so many parts of our organism which are untouchable and that we can´t understand yet. So, the money won´t matter when you have something that is not decipherable and there is still out of the reach of human knowledge . On the other hand, if you are healthy, you can work hard to achieve the social status aimed. Money is something tangible, but being healthy sometimes can be a goal impossible to achieve. So, if you could choose between richness and being healthy, what would it be?

In recent years some students, attending high school or university, decide to study some time in a foreign country instead of studying at home. As far as I can say it is a choice that weighs for better or worse in their future life with probable repentance if not taken in time Although nowadays it seems to be an easy choice to take, deciding to study in a foreign country is not that simple. First of all we have to consider the costs, quite high; secondly the psychological impact has a great component in the final result: students have to adapt to a new life and at the same time to attend the school, hopefully, with good outcomes, not an easy situation to cope with. On the other hand, the possibility to study abroad represents a great opportunity that someone shouldn't miss. Learning a foreign language in the origin country is much better than studying it in another place, it gives the opportunity to improve it day-by-day with live language and apprehend at the same time the local way of living, a good start, envisioning to live abroad in the future. In conclusion, I think that the decision of studying abroad for some time, despite costing quite a lot of money, is a positive choice even just to consider the broader options of future jobs. And it still remains a great life lesson.

Now,let me get this straight. I have not done any mistakes in this trip. It was all my older brothers,Rodrick and Manny's fault. Summer came,and the school had been let out for summer vacation.

So we signed up for a thing called Boating Seas. After we find out,it turned out the Boating Seas thing was just a regular sea sighting. But when we came on the deck,Rodrick was nowhere to be found. And when we find him on the sea,he was as red as a lobster. We had to rub popcicles on Rodrick's back so it would cool down a little. The worst part was sleeping. I have to sleep with Rodrick,which is sticky with popcicle juice. It was not the best holiday,but l enjoyed it. I enjoyed it because l can eat Rodrick's snacks when he was sent to the hospital.

Nowadays, I think is important to tell the truth even thought, sometimes, is very hard to tell. A lot a people believe is important to tell but how many are able to say the truth ? You have to take care about the background who surrounds us because the truth can be a deadline. Nevertheless, lie is not very acceptable even if, this is for gpod. In all cases, one day or another, the truth will be revealed and the lie can be the worst thing ever to do. People lie for hide the truth about themselves. Thinking is something not bad but when it reached the person can be something devastating. That's why, you must be careful when you re lying to someone because you must be aware about the consequences. The truth can be very hard to face and people can be deeply hurt by those actions. However, some people don't really care and use it for themselves and that it is really dangerous. Play between both sides can one day or another go back to you really badly.

The Future of Travel is a prominent topic nowadays! Due to the pandemic, habits have changed a lot and while someone could still persist to believe that travelling will be as easy as in the past, some others are deeply aware of the dramatic changes in the whole world of travelling. Once, for example, we could plan to fly abroad for a holiday by simply choosing the country and reserving the flights, all of this without being forced to consider the quarantine required nowadays on the return home and the additional information about the health conditions compulsory if we want to take a plane. In light of this, the usual two weeks of summer vacation will no longer be enough. We will therefore need to add the days for the restriction and moreover some other days for medical checks. On the other hand, we shall be able to travel safely in remote places such as on the peaks of the mountains or on the outer sea maybe on a private sailing boat for a relaxing vacation. These two examples of holidays, very expensive today, will certainly be much cheaper in the future because they may be more in demand than in the past. Despite all, even with many restrictions, travel will always remain one of the most attractive and richest human activity!

Personally, I'd prefer living a long, calm life until 100 years than living a short'n exciting live, well, depending on how many years you'd live I could change my opinion because a long life and a calm life is very good if you need to relax for studying or for work, but a short and exciting live could be very, very exciting. I rather the long, calm life until 100 than a short life because I really like living relaxed days than exciting days because I won't know what could happen after that day, but living a calm live I could predict in some ways what could happen, and I prefer that, and in the job I like to work in, I could work more efficiently with the knowledge that in the next day it will go good, a bad point in living a long live is that if you do not like nothing in your life and you don't really like what you're doing that day-week-month-year that could be very bad but you can end your life in some sort of ways, some more painfully ways and other painless. If I had to choose one of them, I'd choose the long and calm life, as I am a relaxed person but unfortunately my life isn't that much calm.

Everyone wants to be healthy anh wealthy. If you have both of them is very good. if you are rich you can buy anything you want. You can spend your money without considering so much. If you are not rich you would find it is difficult to satisfy your demands. Someone has to choose one of two things health or wealth. I think it is more important to be healthy than to be rich. Because if you are healthy you can do anything. You can study anything you want, and you can also help other people. If you are ill or not healthy you think about only one thing is that how to get health and you cannot do anything else. If a man was ill for a long time, he would want to be died. Some people do anything to be rich without considering their health and then they would spend all their money to buy medicines for keeping their health.

Which future is going to be for the schools? This is a question that many of us ask ourselves nowadays. Will it be all different? Or will it remain the same? Based on what we experience today, the broad development of information technology takes us to strongly believe that in a not distant future, schools, as we know them today, will certainly disappear. For instance, we can figure that teachers will be replaced by an artificial intelligence which through a computer screen will teach students all over the world. While a totally computerized school might be the biggest change, we hope that at least the following two points will remain the same in the schools of the future; the curiosity of students for new topics and the opportunity for them to deepen their knowledge. In addition, hopefully, not losing the school trips would keep helping students to explore the world and extend their horizon. In the end although a change will certainly happen in the future, I strongly believe that the schools will always remain the perfect setting to enhance the culture and broaden the education of all the students.

Of course there's things that are more important than exercise. But l'll just list some of it so this composition won't be too long. First,food. Food is the most important thing in our life. We use it as a fuel for our bodies,and it's not hard to find in our lives around us. The food was split into:organic food (fruits and vegetables),complex carbohydrates (whole wheat pasta and bread),simple carbohydrates (milk,candy,and any kind of sugar),fats (proteins like meat and beans),and salt (which is likely in most of the food you eat). What l had mentioned is all the important substances that you must take every day. Second,your own life. l can say,your life is the most important thing in the whole world. So that's why we always say don't take your life as a joke to look at. If you were out of this world,you'll miss it. Because you will not be in palace. What you are seeing after you died is a completely dark place with nothing in it. If you had done something really good for the world,then you'll probably be a cat or a dog or something like that. The last thing l'm gonna say is that there are a lot of things that's more important than exercising,but exercising itself was very important too。

Most medial doctors want to work in the big cities in order to make a lot of money or to have a good living. In my country many doctors want to work in the biggest and the fastest growing cities. They are struggling to remain in those cities. In the public health care it doesn't matter if you are working as a doctor in a big city or in a small. You have the same salary. Furthermore, if you work in a small city you will have less work to do and the rent will be cheaper but everyone prefers to stay in a good developed city even is they pay much more for it. I think this problem could pe solved if the medical doctors will be resigned in cities that are close to their parents' house or if the reallocation will be made based on grades. As a result you cannot choose to work in a hospital from a big city that has only medical doctors with 10 as a grade if you have a seven.

In our planet lots of species are endangered, a considerable percentage of wild animals is at risk of extinction and under this light zoos seem to be the last resort for them to survive. Some people could disagree being those animals born free, they may argue that they should keep living that way. I like thinking that wild species should spend their whole life in the native environment. I feel it's unnatural to force them living in a different place out of their native one. For instance, it is unacceptable that a lion accustomed to the heat of savana must be trapped in a zoo in a northern region. Or another example, is to constrain dolphins living in the limited area of a swimming pool. Although this might be the only possibility of a few animals not to become extinct, I still insist on the principle to let them live wild and free. Zoos may be a nice place for children who can get to know creatures that they barely meet in normal circumstances. Though a good footage, performed in the animals' original world could do the same. Once more, I keep thinking that animals should live in the spots where they were born, however, as long as human beings continue to disrespect other living beings on this planet, the zoos might remain the only viable alternative to save those lives from extinction.

It was nice but I didn't like the fact that my co-workers from my left and right could see what's happening on my screen. I also worked in a full open space without anything to separate me from the other cowerkers and it was awufull. You don't have any privacy there. First of all, everyone sees what you have on your screen, second, the noise it's horrible because you can hear every wisper, third, you will feel like you are monitored from behind at every sound of footsteps.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, An announcment has been spread among the citizens of this town stating an intended ban of mobile-phones use in various public areas. To express my objection, I am writing this letter to you; some viewpoints of other co-inhabitants can be found in the attached document. First of all, it is to be pointed out that banning the use of mobile phones is an unprecedent interference into people's human and civil rights, as far as I am concerned. Being convinced that the intention is only for sake of the town, I feel obliged to state that such a political step would doubtlessly lead to a protest. Eventually, some people, myself included, might feel so threatened that they would take the whole issue to the court. As a matter of fact, it would lead to financial burdens and farther dissatiscations. Having mentioned the legal aspect of the case, the matter of safety deserves some attention as well. According to statistics evidence, the presence of a mobile phone has saved many lives. Especially in such a generally dangerous place like traffic, when accidents occur frequently, preventing people from having a mobile on them borders on an attack on their personal safety. As the majority of the town citizens would agree, common sense dictates that the ban would change the citizen's lives for the worse. As a competitive agenda, it is recommended to start a campaign which would encourage people to be more compassionate, polite and sympathetic with whom they share the space. Yours sincerely KS

A struggle many people deal with nowadays is, whether to lead an intense, yet risky life, or if it were not better to stay save and go through their days in rather peaceful manner. It sounds like a Shakespearean dilemma. Let's take a closer look at the issue. It has to be considered that in the current times of social media, everybody's image of a fulfilled life may get blurred or even distorted. A significant fraction of people has experienced the FOMO syndrom, some may have fallen a victim to depression. Both as a consequence of feeling a lack of meaning in the life, according to psychologists. Even though this knowledge does not resolve the issue, it is a crucial prerequisite for finding the core of the matter. Neither the length, nor the intensity of life guarantee the personal feeling of satisfaction due to the fact that they do not equal any meaning. The former should be disregarded in the first place, as it is a significant figure after one's death. During their lives, people do not consider it. The intensity being mentioned, it can be generally assumed that exciting experience may bring a cetrain sense of fulfillment, nonetheless, it has been proven that calm activities, such as meditation, increase one's contentment dramatically. As the whole subject is subjective to large extent, it is complicated to reach a general conclusion. All people have to learn to focus on themselves, what makes them happy and content in order to be able to leave this world peacefully.

I think that this requirement will help our society. We got used to put only the career part in the school but if we want to live like a healthy society we must get used to teach the students how to be humans. The students must be taught how to healp each other and how to take care of the environment. From my opinion it's a great requirement but we must keep it at a reasonable priority. If a student hasn't completed one hundred percent of the task, I think it may be a good thing to close an eye of it. On the other hand if the student hadn't done any volunteer work than I think it would be fair for him to get zero credits. It must be maintained a balance between the teaching at subjects and the teacheang how to be human. In the end I would like to highlight that this certain amount of volunteer work to graduate should be mandatory in any school.

From my view, I would love it if I could study at some musical instrument in high school. It's a difficult thing to approach because you need student if you want to maintain this type of subject in school but you also cannot force students from informatics specialization to do it. A solution could be to implement a different type of stuying class. A teacher could be paid to have some classes during the week and every student from every class or grade could attend. In this way we can satisfy the lack of students and the teacher could teach with entuziasm. I think that students could develop great skills by learning to sing at an instrument. I saw a lot of people who developted a good thinking by learning to sing at some instrument. They where literally learning easily everything at school. In the end I would like to highlight that not all school are willing to develop singing classes.

Hey are booth good choices. It depends on each case because if your family has a lot of money than it is better for the student to stay somwere alone. He could study better and could improve his experience in life. On the other way if the student stays with his family because they don't have money to pay his rent,it can be difficult to keep in touch with his classmates but he will be near his family and it could be easier form him in though times. Every situation comes with it's good parts and bad parts and it depends on the family's bugged or on the family's perception.

In general office spaces are designed to match the room or the building bought or rented to work, they are generally not thought in advance. The result is that some working spaces end up to be smaller than a closet some others turn out to be dispersive. In my opinion, the least effective arrangements between the two is the first one: working in a tight space, sometimes with not even the natural daylight, risks to undermine firstly the employees' mood and secondly their health in general. For instance keeping in the same room, computers, printers and workers can render the whole space too hot and too noisy, therefore not the ideal working place . Another aspect to consider, in separated offices, are the reduced exchanges amid colleagues, this might limit the leverage of the team building culture. I would say that this kind of office arrangements might be fine only if the secrecy is the priority for working purposes. I would definitely prefer working in a wide open space where interactions among co-workers are facilitated. The absence of walls is certainly a good choice in an office to foster a cooperative community as such, in an open space, in case of problems, assistance among colleagues is easier and in addition information runs faster than in separated rooms so that everyone in office is informed about what it is going on. Open spaces help as well to create a friendlier working environment which enables workers to be at ease and contribute in a more positive way to the firm objectives. In conclusion, although little spaces or separated spaces may respect the privacy of workers , in an open space, once more, I do believe that either the workers as well as the firm itself benefit of the arrangements in terms of results and wellbeing.

In my opinion, the books in schools and universities should be replaced completely by tabletes and computers because of some reasons as bellow: First, the computers and tablets can store a huge number of books. One tablets can store as many books as a bid library does. Second, students can find the books in tablets faster 100 times than finding the books in libraries. Students can find the books in other libraries in one sencond without going to that libraries. Third, students can write, draw or anything else on only one tablet. When they do something wrong, they can fix it easily by retyping or erase the wrong things. Fouth, Students do not have to bring so many books to school or university, it is convenient for them. Fifth, each country does not have to print so many books for students, it means that we can reduce the materials for making books. It will reduce the bad effects to the environment.

My English teacher has kindly required us to produce a plan for the forthcoming new school year where we are going to highlight the subjects we love the most, the area we need to improve and the actions we envision to take to achieve our objectives. I would start by saying that I have always loved attending school and studying a lot to broaden my horizons. Among the school subjects those that I prefer the most are history and philosophy as they both represent the physical and psychological path of humanity . Being so passionate about them, I would like to attend a seminar about the medieval age arranged by the local Museum of Medieval History while for philosophy I am planning to attend a online course so that I will be able to deepen my studies. Unlike history and philosophy, the classes that I prefer less are mathematics and geometry which are as well the subjects that need to be improved. Mainly considering that they will be part of the school path for the next four years. In order to reach a good learning level, I have planned to purchase private classes in addition to those already foreseen at school. In conclusion, I hope to have identified the correct areas to improve and have identified the right ways to meet the objectives highlighted above in order to render this new school year as much effective for myself as possible.

Economic is developing so fast and the way to organise a company is changing also. Some companies disigned their office is closed space. In the other hand, some companies have open design, in which there are no walls saperating employees from their co-workers. In my opinion, the most effective is open design. There are three reasons support my opinion. First, managers of a company will manage their staff easier because they can see and monitor all the workers. They can see what workers doing and the workers see their managers too, as the result workers will forcus on their works and produce more products. Scond, the workers of company easily contact with other workers to have more help. It will contribute the team work and built the culture of the company. Third, it will reduce the cost of building the office because there is no need to spend money on building walls. The buildings do not have separated walls will have more space for wokers and will arrange the funitures and equipment easier.

The medical profession should be a vocation , despite this starting point, some doctors prefer choosing to work in big cities to gain a much higher salary. Due to this attitude, many places in the countryside suffer a shortage of medical doctors. It is understandable that after many years of studying for the medical profession, most doctors believe the recovery of the money spent is something they deserve. They therefore tend to look for a job in cities where they will be able to gain better working conditions in terms of money and career. Nevertheless money should not be placed on top of the reasons to practise this noble profession: the idea of being helpful to others or aiming to find, on day, a new cure to an old disease should be the real push to start this profession. Instead, based on what was highlighted above, as a consequence, in many rural areas, doctors seems to be a rarity. Mostly in little villages up in the mountains, the risk of having only one doctor to serve a very wide area is quite common nowadays. Logically, living in the mountains or in the countryside is less comfortable than in a city. With that said, to try and balance this situation, major fringe benefits should be foreseen in these areas in order to render more appealing these locations for the doctors. For instance, a house or car should be added as additional gifts, maybe a preferential lane for a faster career as well might be helpful. Doctors are really important in all our lives and we all should spend more time in thinking how to improve their working conditions in the pursuit of diminishing the risks to lose these professionals not only from the rural areas but also from the country itself.

Once upon the time human knew to sing, at that time human did not have music intruments, but remember the melody of the songs. About two thousands years ago, human invented the music intruments to simulate the tone of voice. In my opinion, studying music should be required in all schools because of some reasons as bellow: First, every one needs to develop both physicque and mental. To develop physicque, human need to do activities such as running, walking, climbing, working, etc. but to develop mental human need to study including studying music. Second, studying music will help one understand the msic notes. Music notes simulate different tone of voices and divided into 14 different frequencies. Each person can rewrite his tone by himseft and he can compose a song after studying music. Third, studying music will help developing human's brain completely. It will help to study the social subjects such as literature, history, psychology, geography,etc. Fourth, studying music and singing will help strengthen throat mucles. it will help his or her voice clearer.

Lots people think that good school results are only granted if teachers do not change over the years; some others believe that a change amid the teachers over the years can be more beneficial. I would start by setting a time range as students have needs differentiated by age: pupils in the primary school certainly need to have a referred point , one teacher to apply not only for school subjects but also as a guide their psychological growth. In the secondary school, instead, in my opinion, students need a change, they need to experience different referees: they will have to begin and face the alternative nuances that life could offer and what a good opportunity by starting at school, with a teacher for various subjects! At College, students are gown up already and they can start to enrich their culture. This is the stage where they have already started to broaden their life vision by embrancing the alternative view points, more professors can be a wide source in this direction. I strongly believe that the richness of human beings is in the variety, in any respect! BH

Recently a number of high schools have required that volounteer work has to be a compulsory students' actvity in order for them to graduate. I believe that this is a fair and important step for the students and their growth, emotionally and professionally speaking. This requirement can certainly help students to better understand the real world outside the school environment . To most of them, first of all, it might give the opportunity to really get in touch with other realities, sometimes very different from their families and their usual way of living. Secondly they can have a sample of the job's world with all its duties and responsibilities. Besides they might as well decide that it could be the job they would like to do in the future as a living. For example, they could volounteer in a kinder garden and then realize that taking care of the children is what they have always dreamt of. For the same reason, they could find out that helping old people in their daily routine might be what they want to do for a living. Although they are not paid for this kind of activities, I strongly believe that thanks to the volounteer work they will receive much more in terms of learning and formation. I would definitely recommend all students to work volountary while studying in order to broaden their horizons and grow as a person and as citizen.

Secondly, I will become more confident when I live alone because I have to think what I should do, how to do and I have to decide every thing.

My name is Josh and I am writing to give a better approach of the no mobile phones new law. I heard on the news that the use of mobile phones will be banned in some public places, shops and restaurants. I think this approach is a little madness. I am positive that we can find another one. For example in the restaurants could be an unwritten rule to obey. The rule will be like "Who is staying on the phone, will pay de bill." In the public transport if you stay on the phone and you are seated, you have to give the seat to somebody else. In the shop if you stay on the phone, you have to give your place from the que to somebody else. The use of phones cannot be banned because many people have many problems. Maybe they want to talk with their sick child or their sick mother or it's an urgency and they must call 911. I am also anxios to find out what is the main reason for this law. There must be something that got into the city's hall nerves. In the end I would like to say that in the future the city hall must be more careful with the new laws because lately, we all laugh of the new laws.

It is important to tell the truth but sometimes the lie is the correct choice. Let's be onest, you can't always tell the truth. In some cases many people prefer the lie and in many other cases the lie is mandatory. For example if someone is dying and you did something wrong to them long time ago, it will not make the whole situation better if you tell him the truth. Another example will be something involving the national security. If the government asks you to lie, you better do it. A lot of lies in our life could be accepted if they were made in the proper situations. Even in family is ok to lie. If its something from you past and you know that will affect your relationship, you better lie if you are sure that no one could find out. Let's be honest, everybody prefers to have peace in their howse. A truth can affect that because everyone could forgive but not everyone could forget. On the contrary we cannot make the lie our weapon. The lie is in some cases good but the truth must be told in all other cases. We can't do bad things because we have the lie to rely on. In the end I would like to say that everyone should first try to say the truth if they can.

Music at school? Music as a school subject or how to learn and play an instrument is compulsory in a few schools while in some others, students are not required to do so. I think that music should always be added as subject to learn in each school at any level being far important to the emotional growth of scholars and as alternative way of learning about history. Just to give an example, learning about the history of music may give the students the opportunity to know about a part of human evolution. If you name, for instance, the period of romanticism , studying Wagner could make them understand the vision of the intellectuals in the nineteenth century. In addition , learning how to play an instrument can definitely help the development of a manual intellegence as well as a sensitive one in most of the students. Although listening to music can be relaxing, learning how to play it might become a more effective tool to use when you need to get rid of the stress. In my view, I wish to underline again the importance of studying music as a school subject at any degree as it will enrich the students' inner world then it will broaden their emotional horizon and in the end, it will add another way to communicate: Music is absolutely another language which can easily talk to heart and soul.

So let they do the work is much better.

Acorrding to my imagination,l think that in the future,we will have some kind of device that some random scientist invented to transport ourselves to anywhere we want. You just press a button or tell the device where you want to go,then you will be right to your destanation. But that probably won't be necessary until the next 2400 had come. So now,let's just talk about the late 2100s. You can read the next paragraph to get more information. First,cars. The cars right now isn't such a big hit for human civilization. But in the future? Then it will be a whole different story. In fact,l can bet 5000 dollars that in the future,the cars will be armed with radar GPS,TV,and a snack bar just in case that the passenger or driver is a bit hungry. The cars can be molded to be any shape,just like Transformers. And most of all,the engine can be on full power (which is 350 miles an hour) to 6-12 hours. Plus,there will be high tech weapons in case of a attack,and it can be completely camaflaged to the things that is around the car.

I practically use the computer everyday because of the pandemic, but in some weeks, I give myself a break on weekends. I usually use the computer to study English, to do some research and to be updated at my professional area. There is another reason why I use the computer and it is related to my leisure time. When I want to relax, I join a site full of free books. That is what I enjoy the most.

Personally I think that being an employer of an office without a " cubicle " is more effective because in a cubicle you can feel less moveable than in an open space because in an open space with other wordkers you could start a conversation more easily than being in a cubicle and I think it's more comfortable for the people because they won't feel more claustrophobic than in other places, I've seen many cubicles and they aren't like in movies or in films, they are pretty small because there are lots of them, I've visited the " claustrophobic " ones and the " open " space ones and I did a research, or well, a survey to know which type of workers work more efficiently and can have a more stable conversation, and what my results says, is that the big space ones are more efficient than the other ones but I don't really know why, and they both can have a stable conversation but I think that seeing the person who you are talking to is better than needing to stand and look over the tiny walls that separate them.

Dear sir, I read an article in a newspaper said that the town council is planning to ban using mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants. In my opinion, I think it is not a good idea because of some reasons bellow: First, today mobile phones are the smart phones. People use smart phones for many purposes such as working, sudying, communicating, etc. Many people do not finish their works before going home and they have to work on the way home. They have to use mobile phones to continue their work. I have applied for this job for 6 months and I have to study more to increase my knowledge and I often use my mobile phone to study the online course on the way going home. I have to save every minute. If the town councile bans using mobile phones on public transport, how could I study any more. I knew that many young people use their mobile phones to study their additional courses in free time. Second, online payment is developing very fast, many people use mobile phones to pay their bills when shopping. I knew that our government encouraged people to use electronic payment. it helps the economic system more transparent. If the town council bans using mobile phones in shops, people have to use cash for their payment and the policy of using online payment of government cannot be conducted. I am a responsible person and I find my responsibility for our country. I would like to recommend that the town council should not isue that ban.

The zoo is nothing more than an exhibition for people. The animals are kept in an environment as much alike as the natural area that they would be living, but this does not mean that they are living as they should be. It´s because they are living in a limited area, not surrounded by other animals or plants that would be their meal. All that they eat are easily given and they do not have to work to get it, so they easily become more domesticated. It´s not just because of this fact, but they are also more used to live around humans. These all make them become more distant of what an animal like them should be. No one likes being encaged because it takes us the freedom that we are so willing to chase for. If we, humans, don´t enjoy it and we are most used to be enclosed in places like our homes, imagine what it would feel for an animal that are used to live in an unlimited environment like the jungle. This drastic change could be devasting and could not just change their mood, but also could change their essence.

The development of the technology brought us lots of advantages especially on the learning field. Today we are able to read articles, projects and books from all over the world without leaving our seats. There is no doubt that this is a huge step for our existence, but we should also be aware that within this growth, there are some losses in the process. One of them is the possible replacement of the books to the modern way of learning through tablets and computers. This new way could take from us the sensation of touching the book, the joy of turning its pages and the pleasure of reading its last pages. The easy way of finding whatever you want online that sometimes are even free can also be a challenge to the survival of writers. This easier path along with all of the distractions that are one click away could be an obstacle to the absorption of content especially to children and young readers. If this is hurdle at home, it can be more difficult to control in schools and universities. The habit of going to a library and getting lost on thousands of books and having to work harder to find the right one can be estimulating and could also make the whole process more fun and more satisfactory.

Nowadays there are many problems in the rural areas, because most people are moving to the cities, and they are leaving the field which give us our food. Because of that there is a lack of doctors in small villages, and this could be very dangerous, if an elderly don't receive medical care in the right time, he or she could die early. First of all, we need doctors everywhere but many doctor don't want to be posted to small villages or towns. This is a problem and the reasons for this problem are uncountables. One main reason could be the money earned by them, it is said that in these areas the salaries are lower than the salaries of the big cities, besides if they are young they won't have many things to do and enjoy in this kind of villages, although a doctor in a small town or village has a quite and calm life besides the charm of living in the field. Second, the solutions of these problems are very easy and very hard at the same time, because the main solution could be that the elderly move to big cities (however this is not gonna happen, like all of us know), another solution could be improve the work conditions of the doctors which work in small villages or give them prizes in order to boost their willing to be posted to these areas. In conclusion we have to take care of our rural areas and elderly people beside take care of ourselves and like it is said in my village "an apple a day keeps the doctor away," this is my today's piece of advice.

It is well known that day after day the requirements in studies are now more difficult than before and some high schools are asking for volunteer work in order to graduate. there is a lot of controversia about this fact in our society, because some people think that teenagers are too young to do this kind of work while the other part has the opposite point of view. On the one hand, we have to say that hard work could teach and boost skills in the teenagers besides the fact that when they are doing this kind of activity they are far from dangerous zones, gangs and other harm stuff, for instance in Spain there are some programs to teach about farming and these programs are done in the army bases around the country. The volunteer work that is made by teenagers could provide them with true knowledge which they could use in their real lives, for example when you work preparing food for poor people, this work gives you two benefits, one the kitchen lessons and the other could be a different perspective of our society. On the other hand, we have to be careful about the situations that our teenagers are exposed, for instance if they are not under super the supervision of an adult they could harmful relations with people that should receive the volunteer work, for example if they are working some drug dealer could offer them drugs. To sum up with both points of view in count, I strongly believe that the volunteer work produces a benefit to our society but it has to be done with adults and without stress the student.

Since my dad was the government president,l am an expert in these things. But according to my dad's opinion,the future school will be decided by the student president. Here's what l think it should be:First,the school students will vote for a student president and the teachers will collect the votes to find which student will be elected. When the student president was elected,different student presidents from other schools will vote again to decide what will the future school will look like. But let's get on topic. First,there will be no use for teachers or black boards. Every class will be taught online with laptop computers. There will be no classrooms. The students would stay in the dorm to study and disguss questions wherever online or with the roommates that are in the same dorm. Kinda like when we're trying to get over the COVID-19 seasons. The teachers will all be perfect knowledge professors. Kind of what you will find in the Ivy League schools. And that's my opinion.

Books and tehnology The computers and tablets should completely replace books in schools and universities because we can broke the books and we will need to buy new ones and it is very hard to find the exact model of the book. If we would have tablets or laptops, it will be easier to study. Our backs won't hurt anymore. If we broke or water the books, we need to buy new ones, but, if we have tablets or laptops, we won't break them because they are expensive and we like them. In twenty years, we won't have books, we will have tablets and laptops but why should we have them in tweenty years and not now? That is the big question. My opinion is to replace them now because studying will be more funny because we can watch videos about that things that we have for school. The tehnology is the future.

There is a heated debate for many years on the availability of medical care in rural areas. Many doctors left these areas to provide medical in big cities. What is more, those who were old had retired. If this trend continues, the situation will not be sustainable. Furthermore, it might soon result in a phase that rural areas lost the ability to provide medical care to the same extent it was before. To solve that problem, we have to deal with arguments that cause this lack of medical care. Let us unpack some of them. Lack of financial sources is one of them. A regular income provided to doctors in rural areas is not so efficient to cover all services linked to providing medical care. Secondly, another reason is the attractiveness of the location where we want to invest in medical care. Lack of infrastructure, for example. The infrastructure and transportation system is playing an important role. If we take it seriously and tackle that problem successfully, we have to provide a proper background.

Banning the use of smartphones. We see accidents related to smartphones in the news every day and many people injured are kids. The city halls of many towns have the idea of banning the use of smartphone while the pedestrians are walking, this is a way to stop this kind of accidents and save many lives, but this idea was very controversial when it was launched. To begin with this idea, we can reduce the number of dead in city centers, for instance if you don't see to both sides of the street while you are writing a message a car could hit you. Maybe you don't die in this accident but you could spend months in the hospital. Secondly, we have the money idea, for example when there is an accident we use a lot of money repairing cars, sidewalks and urban furniture, besides the salaries of workers, doctors, policemen, firmen, etc. With this law we will be able to use the taxes in better things and not in repair streets. The last year we spent three millions of euros in my town because of the car accidents, if we had not had many accidents we would have used the money in other issues. In contrast to this idea, some people could think that this idea could break the people's freedom and they have reason, because this is a law that forbide you the use of things that you bought, besides the next idea, you could think that the city hall only want save money, not protect our lives. To sum up, I strongly believe that if you want to send a message you can stop, write and send the message and go on with your path, I support this idea and I hope that when we have this law we will reduce our dead.

During the last 10 years, university students and school children have changed their way of playing and spending their spare time gaining new unhealthy habits. Younger generations have been starting to spend lesser time outside than the older ones, preferring playing computer games or simply watching television rather than thinking of a game to do outside such as playing hide-and-sick or playing football or even simpler just take a short walk. Not playing often outside, spending instead most of the time sat on a chair or on a sofa, the bad result on their health has started to show heavily. In order to avoid worse consequences on the adult life, doctors and health experts would suggest forcing them to do any physical activity at least three times a week. I definitely agree with this suggestion. I believe that children, teenagers and young adults should be educated in a new culture for a healthier body by drawing their attention to the sports activities and besides this, I would add as well, the stress on a healthier diet would not do any harm. Whatever kind of physical or leisure activity which involves mouvements would fit perfectly with this new kind of education. Therefore not only taking a swimming course or a football training, but also taking the stairs instead of the elevator, going to school on foot or by bike instead of by bus or by car, could be a good start towards the right direction to improve the bad unhealthy habits. Parents should help their children in this task as they look at us as an example, always. However the frantic modern life can sometimes refrain us from taking a healthier behaviour because it could look like more difficult. As long as we, as adults, do not change our static lifestyle, we will not be able to push our children to explore new healthier habits. If we wish to gift them with a health adut life, we will have to begin soon.

Student not only study sciolism but also study moraliry. They need to develop not only knowledge but also physic. Some schools have a requirement that students have to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. I think it is a good way for students study morality and it will help to develop the physic of students. Students have more opportunities of studying in real life and things. They will study how to do in a team work and organize working. They would face to difficulties when doing something, and they will find out the way to solve the problems and how to cooperate with each other for doing work well. They have more social activities when doing voluteer work. The more activities they have, the more development of physic they will.

I don't know how to approach this subject. It is odd to ask a person if he wants to live long or intense because everyone wants both. Regarding the answer I have to give, it depends on the type of life. I wouldn't like to live only 20 years and intense but I also wouldn't like to live 100 years and to be like a robot. The way I see it, a good life is one lived with balance. I see myself living intense not like a robot but also not like a morone. To give an example: I would definitely go to parties but not to get in a coma from alcohol. This word "intese" have to have it's own boundaries. We have to live intense with responsibility. I also don't see myself in the other extreme. I have friends who dosen't like to fly because they are scared of earplanes, but we both know that is safer in the air. I am a man who likes the put balance in everything, especially in life. I don't like to be extreme, even if it's about the left or the ight part of the boundary. We all have to live an intense life but with responsibility and in this way we'll live a long and intense life and we will achieve everything we propose.

Nowadays, people are not doing exercise owing to their long working hours. Due to inactive life they will lead to some health problems in the future. For young people some of foundation such as universities or schools may help students to avoid inactive lifestyle. Initially, they can forced the sportive activity to students to get habit for them. First of all, educational foundations can show many paths for students to be healthy. Universities can help children to be active with antrenors, dieticians and teachers who are professional in field of sports. Nevertheless, students will teach to manage their time thanks to active life. if universities forced students to do activities at least three times per week, students' psyhological lives will be more regular for them. it is a well known the fact that exercise help people who have a depression or anything psyhological disease. On the other hand, students have not managed their time owing to heavy working. Universities want that students use their time efficiently. Furthermore, if students do exercise properly, they can motivated substantially when they do other hard working. This way which is applied by the schools is not force in fact. It is just provided for healthy life. Some people think that universities or schools cannot force students for doing exercise. Their idea is wrong I think because Universities do not earn money from students with this path. They think this idea wrong in terms of economic income. Even they think it is a wrong, no doubt that exercise help students with many aspects To sum up, it is a well known the fact that exercises help all people for healthy life. Thereby, universities should forced students doing exercise three times per week. Thanks to this path students get used to doing sports in their life.

Studying at university is an important choice in life and as a consequence, in relation to the chosen school, it is sometimes necessary to move from home. Some students decide then to leave home and stay on their own while some others choose to stay by their families. The first decisive factor, establishing whether to stay with parents while studying at the univesity or to leave home, is the economic aspect which most of the times determines as well the choice of the univerisity to attend. In my opinion, I would suggest staying home with parents so that students could totally dedicate their time to study instead of trying to balance school and job. Thinking just about the school may help to get over the university in due time and obvisouly by respecting the timetable, it results in an additional cost saving. On the other hand, if students decide to leave home and live by themeselves while studying, they have first of all to consider the additional cost of a rented apartment. They need then to start thinking of their life as an adult one with all its consequeces. For example, they definitely need to look after their new house, think on how to arrange the daily routine such as shopping for meals or cleaning the house. All actions that take time from their studies. In addition, should they need to look for a job to gain a living, they will have lesser time for school. In some cases, this situation can lead the students to withdraw from university. At the end, I strongly believe that the best and the most effective way to study at the University is to choose a school not very far from parents' home in order to stay with parents and dedicate all the energy towards the successful conclusion of the school career.

One day I was talking with my English teacher about the difficulties that I have when I'm trying to study English alone and the main problem that I have is the difficult to know if what I'm writing is correct or incorrect ?

One of the most difficult choices in life is related to the profession that we want to follow until we die. That´s a thought a little harsh to seek and to believe in as well, but unfortunately it is a common belief among adolescents and young adults. The entire journey needed to make that ultimate choice shouldn´t be dealt with so much severity. We are not supposed to stick to that decision if we find out along the way that it is not our calling. That decision is susceptible to changes. The schools and all the professionals inserted in this world don´t offer to the students the correct tools needed to make such an important decision like a phychological assistance and a certain transparency of all the obstacles that they will face along the construction of their professional lives. The problems are even beyond this flaws in the educational system. Nowadays, the teenagers don´t have enough patience to pursue greatness, because to achieve that level of success takes a lot of effort,commitment and a certain resilience when nothing is working out. There is also the error of judment that greatness and success should come along with mountains of money and recognition. They don´t realize that greatness and success are a state of mind and spirit and they should bleed happiness and well-being. When they are looking for success and a faster way to earn money, they all think that there is one way to accomplish it that is being a doctor. The unhappy reality is that they are right. Medical doctors who have just graduated earn more money than any other professional. This eager search for richness become their main purpose on their professional lives and they forget about the ultimate vow that they have made at their graduation. They should assistance and provide medical care to those places where is needed and to whoever is claiming for help. They shouldn´t be moved by greed, but by humanitarianism and sympathy. This is a current issue that just can´t be fixed rapidly, it takes a lot of commitment and planning mostly by the government and the educational system. Sadly, one of the main reasons that made them choose to become doctors may be the solution for this hurdle. The government should offer more money to those who apply for work at rural areas and other regions that are lack of medical assistance until the educational system shows results from their improvements.

An environment that provides comfort and silence it is almost always the perfect place for any worker at a work place. When you give privacy to an employee, he feels comfortable, calm, relaxed and safe. Those characteristics remind him of a safe place and because of that, he will be more open and free to be himself out of the looks, pressure and critical expressions and words of his co-workers. This private area will relax him enough to induce his criativity and productivity. The results of an enclosed workstation will appear at the quality of the work presented by the employees and also at the amount and agility of the tasks done by them daily. On the other hand, those offices with open design don´t have walls that can provide privacy to the employees. The privacy that comes with the walls offers a distance from the pressure caused by critical looks from co-workers and also offers a certain sound barrier between them. The lack of sound barrier is probably one of the main reasons why workers get so distracted during their daily work. When you are at an environment that you don´t feel comfortable enough to do your job, it can be quite challenging to achieve your level of concentration to start a task. When you finally got back on track, someone starts talking on the phone or with someone near you. That action disturbs anyone, even the most focused person and you will get a hard time trying to keep going with your work. Even though when those conversations are over, you will spend another few minutes to get back to the rhythm and the level of concentration that you were before you were interrupted. Those precious minutes stolen from you daily due to the loss of focus, will certainly affect not just your productivity and quality, but also the entire office.

In every corner of the world, there is someone who knows a talented person who could have been an incredible professional if it was given him the opportunity to develop this gift. It is known that it´s never too late to accomplish great things, but in some areas this truth it is not applied like in the world of the sports. Even though some people take that statement as a mantra in their lives, others think that those words belong only to a fairy tale world. These ones don´t think that the option to dive in to a new profession and leave behind years of commitment and dedication to their current profession it is a valid one. I can´t blame them because the unknown can be really terrifying and this fear may be bigger than the wish to feel connected to their inner truth. Sometimes when a talent is discovered later in life, it can be more a curse than a gift because this person will be suffering from all that he could have done with it. He will regret it, will find someone to blame and maybe will feel bitter for the rest of his life. We are often wasting thousands of talents because we don´t offer the opportunity to each one of them to find out their calling. One solution to this error could be corrected through programs at schools. Schools need to offer to the students diverse programs of dance, sports, music and other areas so that they can choose themselves in which one they are more connected and comfortable on doing it. Those programs should be a part of their educational system as an obligation subject. At that age, adolescents and children have to be sometimes encouraged to make a move because science already confirmed that the part of our brain related to making decisions it is not fully developed until 18 years old. That being said, all the students should experience all kinds of classes like music classes. If they found out during those periods that they don´t have the talent or they don´t want to pursue it in their lives, they can bring this new ability to their daily lives as a hobby. Music is always welcomed in anyone´s lives. Music can give us peace of mind, change our mood, increase our concentration and help us to overcome and release a feeling that has been harming us and jeopardizing our growth.

My reasons for learning English To make a long story short,l will place my reasons in two different paragraphs. First,l'm Chinese. which means l'm foregin. lf l can study the English launguge very well,l can get respect from my fellow students. Both in my own home China or in the America. l can have a life making by just being a professor in a college teaching business English. Second,almost 2/3 the people speak English in the world . So l can have lots of friends with just using one lauguge. The third reason however,was a little like the disadvantages of studying English. The only problem is,that l'm afraid of if my English was so well,we can't commuicate. So better just do some at a time. And here l'm not only talking about me,l'm talking to all of the guys and gals who study English. If you really want to study English,l recommend you to be a student teacher to see how you can teach.

It's more important to be healthy to be rich. I follow and respect this statement,but there are a touch. How can you be healthy when you are poor? Like,if your family had no money,then how do you keep yourself healthy? You'd starve to death. Or,if you sit on road,begging others to throw money into your cup,you'd be very weak because the disease lying around the street ground. So if you are poor but healthy you still will be weak. That's way when Barack Obama got to be president,he had a prgramm called BamaCare. It's about if one people got invovled in a terrible accident and the person was badly hurt,the medical expenses will be mostly paid by the government if it's difficult to pay at once. But let's look at the different side. If you are very wealthy but not healthy,you still can recover by eating pills and resting. After all,money can particularly buy anything. Except money,people,and time. So the statement"It is more important to be healthy than to be rich." is partly not true.

First,l have to point out that l had no offense or enemy-ship with HUAWAI,MIX,oppo and vivo (ICYMI, these are all big electronics companies). But my theory is that electronics can never replace something in the eduacational board. Or at least,not completely. If you ask me,Should computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities? My answer is that it depends on how you use it. l mean,it is possible that computers and tablets completely replace books in schools and universities as long as everyone knows how to use it properly. You open your iphone,and instead of studying,you play a game. Then in this case,computers and tablets absolutely can't replace books in schools and universities. But if you open your hybrid school website,and you study very hard in it,then computers and tablets can completely replace books in schools and universities. So it really depends on who you are and what you are going to do on the electronic device.

Dear town council, I wrote this letter because 15 families from Star Street had chosen me to be delegate, this letter articulate all Star Streets villigers emotions, feelings and thoughts. I have been living in this town for 70 years. I was born in this town. Me and my family's daily routines were very diffiucult when I was a child. There were no technological devices, machines for farming and communicating devices but that was 65 years ago. I and many of town members wished to have some technology. There were different members in town councils in those years. One day they asked us if we wanted to have telephones. Then they said they would get the substructure ready for telephone lines. On that day we got used to use mobile phones everywhere. We all have been very thankful to old town council because mobile phone made very big change in our lives. We all had been using our mobile phones happily before this bad idea was clarified by town council. Many of us have children, relatives and grandchildren who live in city centers; we want to communicate with them easily everywhere. We like our town's development. We all agree that we have a right to make phone calls, send messages to put it simple use mobile phone. We don't want you to introduce that kind of law in our town. Best regards, Eva Sparks and The Star Street Villigers.

Nowadays telling or not telling lie is being used as they the same thing by actually teenagers who represent our future. If we take a look the history there have always been people who tell lies. Even in children fairytales had villains who tell lies. But in today's modern world population of people who can tell lies increased. In my opinion in the future lies will be being told by people because there can be situations which's are dangerous and vital. For me in that kind of situations it is acceptable to tell lies whichs not affect other people's life. I want to give an example in my life. When I was I child I used to be naughty student in the class. One day I had an argument with my classmate. I had started telling bad words to my classmate before she did the same thing to me. After hours I came to my home, my mother asked me if I was guity in that argument and I lied to her. The day after my mother learned the truth and she felt very bad. On that day I understood that in the world there are very precious things when we tell lies those things are dying. If I hadn't told that lie on that day I would have told lies nowadays. In conculution, we should be honest. Everyone need to understand the importance of honesty.

Hi,Pen Friend. I was thinking,and l thought l should recommend you some entertainment. So picked this film out for you. It's called,Fire Anger. This movie has blood,knife,and guns. The main story revolves around a police that catch the bad and deal with bloody consequences. I'm not going to give you anymore information or you won't have any interest of watching it. By the way,this is my favorite movie.

Nowadays, some people have a bad habit of using the mobile phone, what is not true is the mobile phone is bad to human beings, many officers can use it to work online, and get information about what happens around us, waht's more, we can also invest in stocks, and students can use it to study online. So, personally speaking, I can't agree with this idea. First and foremost, mobile phone is benefit to us, we can use it to contact with our parents, and play games to unwind us, I know there are many debates about how the mobile phone should be banned, my opinion is absolutely not. As I said, mobile phone is benefit to us, but try to transpositional consideration, you may discover that prople can't leave the mobile phone anymore, if the mobile phone was banned in the public areas, the individuals can't ring others, or get some information in time, and the time also becomes difficult to control. Additionally, mobile phone may do harm some people, they decrease the relationship between the family, and make people become estranged from each other. However, it is not the mobile phone's faults, but the way to use them, and I think the town council should lead people use it in a correct way, but not banned it in public areas, this method will sharpen contradictions, and make the situation worse, even destabilize society. All in all, as the saying goes, we should be channeling, not blocking, we should lead the citizens a right way to use them, and I believe the mobile phone, the crystallization of science and technology,can modify the society more wonderful.

Well, This tool is very important to improve my skills in writing, online feedback is the best practice to fix the flaws in the texts. Things that I liked: Online feedback, Short tasks, small problems to solve, progress analysis, levels to pass, and also being an online tool is very important too. Things I didn't like: I'm missing a graph showing the complete evolution of all the exercises, because I can only see the last ten ranking. One diferential of this tool is the intuitive design it's very simply to use and comfortable to write, other feature that can improve our skills in writing text maybe it's an online dictionary, this feature would make writing much easier. Other characteristics of this tool, is qas the easy that I have to find in an online search, I found this tool in a simple search on google, and the free option to exercise my writing is the factor that caught my attention.

Nowadays, the internet and The way of life at home contribute to the inactive lifestyle, the citizens can without step out the door but get the takeaway and all of the things that life necessity, so somebody come up with a idel that all university students and school children should be forced to do sports at least 3 times per week. As far as I'm concerned, I can't agree with this idea, it is good to promote national exercise, but should not be forced but should be channelled. First and foremost, people of all ages have something they must do, like the students, they have to prepare for the term final exam, and the fresh man need to study hard to get credits, and the graduates may have prepared for interview and work hard until steady so that they can't do sprots, so, it will intensify many society contradictions, moreover, it may causing trouble for a lot of people. Additionally, there are variety of approaches to deal with national inactive lifestyle phenomenon but not the only way to force students and children work out at least 3 times every week, for example, the government can hold some citizens games, or shot some promote video to encourage the individuals work out frequently which can benefit them a lot, all this way are better than force them to do sports. What's more, teenagers and children may have the reble mentality, and I convinced that if the government wanna to implement some policies, some punitive measures are bound to be enacted, in that case, some family don't want their children be punished, so they will force them to do sports which teenagers and children don't want to do, so the gaps of renlationship will appeare which will lead to truancy rate surge, and finally cuase the suicide rate increase. All in all, I know it is critical to improve national physical fitness,and let the young love the feel of going outside but not sit in morden buliding all the day, but may some better options could be chosen.

Since the first human settlements, music has been part of our lives. Archaeological evidences has shown different types of musical instruments of each culture discovered until now. These cultures created their own music and instruments to play it. Music looks to be an essential manifestation in human life. Music has been important in human groups as a demonstration of identity and support, like national anthems, songs to celebrate battles, to remember ancestors and to celebrate new births. Further, music has joined historical events around the world and now it has became a support to new social claims and movements too. The reason why music is part of human life, is because it makes us feel sensatios with more intensity. Each human emotion is boost with music, some kind of music makes us feel powerful, other makes us feel happy, other makes us feel sad and other makes us feel proud. Even though there are some types of music which makes us feel all emotions with a single song. Thus, music is a loyal partner in our lives, it is magic which enters by our ears, it is transformed and comes out like corporal movements and sensations. Without music human life would be boring and gray.

We need music in our lives. Seroiusly,l can't believe why can you even call a life without BGM a life. Here's why l think so:First,we need to listen to songs without music and compare it to regular songs with the BGM. Totally big difference. When you are listening to a song without BGM,you're not listening to a song any more,you are listening to some random people particularly reading this song lyrics to you. Most importantly,music can help us relax. Like when you have a hard day,you can put on any music you like when you are in the shower to get your muscles slow down a take a break. If the stuff l said before did not persude you into believing that music is impoartant,good. If yes,even better. Because just imagine what will the world be like without bands and CDs. The happy birthday song will just be some lyrics. The parties will be just a cool set up with refreshments and games. Not fun. Plus,music resturants will lose the business just because music didn't exist anymore.

Yes, we need music in our lives because it relaxes us. Music is not just for fun, it is used to change our mood, when we listen to a song something happens in our brain that make us happier. Sometimes we are studying with focus and listening to music at the same time, sometimes we need silence and turn off the music to be able to focus on something. Music is important to us like water or food, it is essential and today more and more people are listening to music when doing daily activities. Without music our life would have less joy, we like music because we feel better when we hear a rhythm. Although something opposite happens when other people listen to their music at a volume that we can hear, in these cases we have the opposite feeling, we are annoyed because we don't like to hear the music that other people like. There are many styles of music around the world, and there are times when one rhythm is better than the others because we have different feelings throughout the day.

Music is playing a keying part in our lives, I think. It is the same as a fish without water. Let us break and look at the importance of music in our life. Imagine music as a powerful tool that can change our mood in a positive or even negative way. To give an illustration, when you listen to music you do not love too much, it makes you feel angry. Conversely, you can listen to music that makes you feel happy. However, there is also a state of mind in which we need a pause. Let us say it differently, your mind got to a point where music can cause negative feelings and what we need is silence. By and large, music has a disruptive effect on our brains. Finally, I cannot imagine my life without music. Music helps me overcome difficulties, change my attitude, think better about something and I would continue. Music keeps me above water in most things.

For me the music is not important. It is fundamental! I can't live without her! I listen to the music all day and all days. Music is culture. Each time period, every historical event had his soundtrack. Just think of Bob Dylan and the American revolution, or Also Guthrie and the Vietnam war for example. Another, Pink Floyd and the Berlin wall. And every nation has his own kind of music! It is fantastic! Music is also entertainments, concert and disco are some examples. Another, music is relax too. And we can't forget the music therapy. But music is also natural noises like wind, rain, the waves on the sea, animal sounds. Can we imagine a world without music? Or a film without soundtrack? I think the answer is no! Music is a kind of magic in our life.

The best season of the year. Have a favourite season of the year is not a rule for everyone. Sometimes people prefer winter, sometimes those same people prefer summer or spring, and the reason is not easy to understand. Summer is my favourite season but I like winter or spring the same way, it depends on my mood in the year and depends on the conditions I'm in in a specific year. We as humans like the sun and clear days with few clowds, this kind of day makes us happier than other days. The winter have more cloudy days and are grayer than other seasons, on these days people's mood changes to melancholy and some people are less happy than in other days. It depends on the moment the person is going through and the activity they need to do that day. The seasons are inevitable, my recommendation is to relax and enjoy every moment, you will adapt and see beauty of the seasons the older you get.

Every professional around the world would like getting a good job. Getting a job with a great salary, with enough equipment to work and with options to learn more to do his labor the best. This is a rasonable desire because each professional invested a lot of time and money in his academic training. However, all these professionals forget the first reason to train in a particular career, which is to solve problems, help and support actions to improve human lives. This reason is remarkable in healthy careers as medicine and nursing. Unfortunately, selfishment is increasing nowadays and searching of a good and comfortable life as well as possible is more important than other professional aim. Further, governments don't promote to medical doctors to contribuite with medical services to these people. Governments don't want to offer to doctors good salaries or safe places for working. So, even though a few medical doctors want to help these people, they are not able to do it because they don't have access to basics supplies and conditions to do their work.

For some people it may not be a compete rocket science however some may wrap their head around this question I'm about to present. Would you rather live a long calm life or would you prefer short but intense life instead? Let's dive into that... On one hand we have long peaceful life, which I bet many introverts would according to studies choose over chaotic intense life. Life full of happiness, friends or even family. Sounds like a dream come true, doesn't it? Have you ever wondered though what you'd do with this long period of time in your hands? Your life might get bored after a while not doing anything exciting. On the other hand however we have short yet more intense life full of adventure, memories and good laughs. This option sounds more appalling to outgoing and sociable people. There are cons to this option for certain and it's up to every single one what seems more likeable to them. I, personally, would without a doubt choose the second option being shorter yet more intense life. I'm aware nobody specified the exact period of time I'd get to live, nonetheless picturing myself siting on sofa maybe rading a book for perhaps 60 years seems like a waste of my time whereas adventures even small ones for instant simply appeal more exciting and I desire a life where I can turn back to see what I happened to achieve or simply look back with a smile on my face knowing I have done everything I'd wished for.

Yes, computers and tablets can replace books in schools and universities because they are easier to use than books. The problem is not using a book to learn something, it's the time it takes to find an answer, much longer than necessary. Children currently use smartphones, computers and tablets from the first days of life, usually a baby comes into contact with a screen in the first month of life. Children grow up knowing how to use a digital tool to find something or solve problems. The answer to everiyhink is on the internet, we need little time to find what we need, so why we need to spend much more time looking for something in a book? With a tablet in hand we have access to many books, we have a library in hand, we can change the book we are reading by closing and opening another in two clicks. Despite the advantages, a book has a charm, some people like to have a book in their hands, see the book in their physical libraries or read something on the pages instead of on the screens.

English is the most used language to communicate with other people when you are in a foreign country, but Chinese will be used more and more in the future. If you work for a global company, you need to learn English, knowing a foreign language is essential to get a job in a multinational corportation. In the past, the internet was not well developed, we had fewer tools to communicate with other people, and we basically used cell phones to talk long distance. Our parents work in local companies so they didn't need to speak another language, but the reality has changed and today everyone needs to know a foreign language to work. I think that in the future, leaning a language will be easier, with the advent of new tools we will learn English easily than in the past.

Television entertains, but can it also educate? The answer to this question is no. Today, television programs are not used for educational purposes, broadcasters need an audience, and to achieve their goals they broadcast all kinds of content without bothering to show important things. We have more options today than in the past, with the advent of the internet we can choose what we see. We don't have time to sit in front of a TV to watch sometinhg something that is always interrupted advertisements for products we don't need. If I need watch some entertainment, I'll open a streaming tool like Netflix, Amazon, Dysney, HBO or similar. I don't have to wait to see something I'd like to see, I just look for the entertainment I want to see it instantly. If I need to learn something, I'll look for the information on the internet, fewer people are watching television and this number will continue to drop. I think the future will be to have cable TV packages with a flexible set of channels that we choose ourselves. Do you think I'll be right with these predictions?

The School of the future will be better than in the past, with the advent of the internet access to information is increasing impressivively. I think schools will be different in many aspects, the learning process will be enhanced with many digital technologies like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and digital plataforms. Although these technologies are better current ones, I think that some things might will not change, such as dependence on the professor, the contact with other children, the school environment that favors interaction and the different levels to reach knowledge gradually. Perhaps education is tailored to the particular needs of students, leading them to reach their greatest individual potential. The form of education itself impose the same form of education on all children, and this is not the best practice to train smart people, it just prepares the children to solve the same problems by getting them to into low-paying jobs. We need to change the format of the schools to improve the education of society so that we can compare ourseves with people from developed countries. The power is in our hands!

In my opinion, music is awesome. I listen to music to do almost everything in my life, like run, clean the house, or work. In my case, music makes me feel happy and strong to struggle with my life. I don't know how I will survive without music. One of my favorite things to do is going out to the pub and listen to music and drink beer. I have watching rock concerts since I was young. I like almost all kinds of music, but my favorites are rock, electronic and mpb. In 2019 I went to Tomorrowland, which is one of the most famous electronic festivals that has in the world, it is located in Belgium and happens only on the weekend. In Tomorrowland is possible to know people from every country in the world, all of them are looking for relaxation, enjoy the music and sometimes make a date. It was my first experience at the big festival and I can say that it was gorgeous, I feel the flow of the music and the energy of the place in my heart and my mind. I suggest everybody that likes music go to a place like this to know exactly how much do you like music and people, for me it was very good because I love music.

Dear John, How are you? I hope you are in good health. As for me, I am fine and all the others in my family are fine too. How did you spend your last holidays? As for me, I cleaned my room and then watched a movie. It was about a family who moved to a new house. The name is Totoro and it is one of the most famous movies of Studio Ghibli. The reason why I like this movie was that when difficulties came, they faced together and tried to solve together. It was so much fun and the storyline was so lovely. So, I think you should watch this movie too. Your lovely, Anna

I think that using computers and tablets in schools and universities has both advantages and disadvantages. Nowadays, the world become more up to date than the past years. Especially, the students use computers as a learning tool. One of the advantages of using computers is that the students don't need to carry heavy backpack anymore. They can go to school happily. The next one is that cause the students use computers and tablets in schools, they are keep in touch with technology since they are young. So, I think that there will be no problems about technology in workplace. But there are some disadvantages of using computers and tablets in schools. Some of the students have eye diseases because of using computers. And computers and tablets are expensive nowadays, so some students can't effort to buy it. In conclusion, although there has some disadvantages in that statement, I still believe that using computers and tablets in schools and universities is essential thing for students.

As you know arrangement of your office at the workplace you work in is playing an important role. Moreover, it also has an impact on your feelings, communication with your colleagues and mind. In the first group, you can find workers who prefer to be in closed and separated areas equipped with no special furniture. However, they put a lot of effort to arrange their offices in a simple way but in the spirit of the latest design and modern furniture to feel much more comfortable. To be more precise, they prefer their offices with daylight from the outside through the windows. From the above, we can understand that those people have a weakness for presenting well-being. They also like small and well-organized places where all things have their own place. In addition, they must visually present their success in the way to show their awards and diplomas on the walls of their offices. The other group of workers tend to have simply arranged offices with no special design. Those offices usually have a purposeful arrangement. By and large, simple arranged office dominates. Notably, places for others who come in to discuss a problem or even participate in a meeting is not missing. Conversely, those places in which workers spend at least eight hours per day would be comfortable. For example, their workplaces are equipped with places where people can meet and have a short break for discussion. In my view, the second example of an arranged office seems to be the most persuasive. To clarify my opinion, I am a person who loves to be surrounded by positive and communicative people sharing their ideas. If someone asks me what I would suggest having in my office, I would say nothing special – in a roundabout kind of way. Last but not least, the more effort you put into the design of your office the comfortable you will feel there.

These days we are witnessing heated debates about students volunteer work. Students in high schools had to make their commitments to undertake a certain amount of hours of volunteer work to graduate. To be more precise, they were given a chance to choose one from the school’s offer. There were counted around 100 volunteer works positions available. However, many of them had to turn a blind eye to this requirement and say it is not by school standards. There are two sides of the coin. On one side, it is obvious that in some countries we can find schools aimed at practical use. To give an illustration, plant growing and other manual works needed to be practised. In fact, to receive a certificate of qualification. As a final stage of your education, you will be asked to undertake a test or an exam to show your gained knowledge at a certain level. On the other side, some schools are not aimed at education included manual or similar work. Those students are prepared for a high level of education or in the managers or leaders positions within an organization. For example, the financial sector or they even work in the field of education. If I look at both sides, I have to admit my disagreement with the implementation of volunteer work in schools. Students should not be forced to earn money for their education. In my view, the responsibility to educate each generation of students is on the government. What I am trying to say is that parents of children would not pay for their education. If we want to have a growing economy in the future, we have to invest and participate more in developing our pillar of education. If I had a chance to make a change, I would have given more money from the government budget to the education sector. Another key thing to remember is to reduce and replace old methods of learning by using new technology.

Many would say that an intense brief existence could be harsh to choose if they were given the opportunity to decide how to live their life, but not for me, because I would definitely opt for it. I would take the chance to go back in time, rewind my 'life tape' and restart from the beginning to live each and every single moment as it were the last. I am thrilled by the etymology of the lemma 'life', a concept bound to energy, an essence that all human beings have inherited and can reproduce in many different forms. Energy generates life, in a circle that is timeless and infinite. From an holistic point of view I see a short lifespan as a flood of experiences and events, a concentration of feelings and emotions which most of the historical figures like poets, writers, scientists have lived. I would have loved to be like them and I would prefer leaving a trace and make my life an exciting trip. In fact, it makes me wonder that I would exciting to experience as much as I could, in order to make my life worth of living. My still young life has taught me that deep feelings bring inevitably struggle, pain, disappointment, uncertainties and agony, but life should not be as beautiful as it is without them. There is a need to know that the bright side of a thriving life comes next, when we disappear, and the memory of what we did will live forever. I live mine in the same way, as a rush of feelings, even though I don't know when it will last.

It is more important to be healthy than to be rich, this statement could be aplied for some preople but is not a rule for everyone. Sometimes be healthy is not guarantee for a happy life, be healthy without enough money to supply the basic needs is not a desirable life. In the other hand, be rich without health is not enjoyable, the most important thing is the balance between both things. People need enough money to survive with the minimal comfort and be healthy enough to live without restrictions. Some people work hard to save money during the entire life and spent this money trying solve health problems that had created trying save more money. Being healthy or being rich is a sensitive issue, some people prefer one and others prefer the other, we need to be understood what is most important to us and not make value judgments about the other decision. If a person is happy being healthy without money or being happy with lots of money without health, no problem, this is a particular choose.

Taveling is one thing that made people feel better in their lives, not only to share experiences with friends but to improve their own life experience, When we know a new culture and visit new places our universe expands and we know that our daily work makes sense. In my opinion, the future of travel will not be much different from the present one, maybe some things will be different like transportation or things like that, but the travel itself or the desire for travel will not change. The need for travelling might still be the same, people need travel, it is a habit raised in all humans, and this will not change. One thing I think will be different in the future, is the places that people will go, some places in the earth will be changed by global warming, and some people will choose other places to avoid problems with climate. Another thing I think will be different, is the improvement of digital solution to travelers, like automatic translators that will enable every person to communicate with others without the language barrier. Who knows what the future holds?

Exercise is important to our health, but are there things that are more important? I think not. Without health we cannot do anything, we depend on our bodies to do everything in our lives. If we don't take care of our health, who will do it for us? Exercise is not a pleasant activity, but it is necessary, we need exercive thirty minutes a day to be healthier, it doesn't take longer than that time to make our bodies better than people who don't exercise. Sedentary lifestyle is a modern problem that causes many problems in society, many health problems can be solved with daily exercise. Some people argue that have no time to exercise, but it is not true, if you analyse the rountine of these people, you will find time to practise some exercises, exercise is not a question of time, is a matter of wanting to. If you want, you will find time do exercese, money is important, but without health you won't be able to use the money you save. Think about that, and change your life style. The power to change your life is on your hands, use it and enjoy the path.

The best holiday I ever had was the Cristmas of 2018, I were in Uruguay in this holiday on a roadtrip. We had arrived in Montevideo on holiday when we realized that there is nothing open, we didn't have anywhere to have lunch or where to buy food or meals. This was no problem as my wife and I were able to walk around the city without traffic, we saw many beautiful places and in the night, we ate bread with turkey pate because there were no restaurants open. It was the best holiday I ever had because there was no people in the streets, we could walked alone in the city, and drove in empty roads, we could move through the streets as fast as possible, and we knew all city in one day.

Some people believe that it is good for students to have the same teacher for several years. Others think that students benefit more from new teachers each year. I think both options are good, when the students have the same teacher for several years, they will understand the model of the teaching that the teacher has and will adapt themselves to focus more os classes than on things like the uncertainty about which teacher they will have in the next class. Nonetheless, have different teachers is good too, when the students have new teachers every year, they might be more sociable compared to other students, they adapt themselves to other realities, have other opinions and ppints of views, and are more adapted to real live situations when they will meet new people every day. How I argue, the fist or the second option have benefits and issues, the better option is to choose a hibrid model, mixing both options to improve the students knowledge and adapt them to different situations. We can only choose a teacher for the student's first five years and after making them choose a different teacher each year, in this model we can have the benefit of both options and reduce the bias we could have adopted only one option. If we analyse our learning model, we can see a lack of opportunities of learning that restricts the skill of students just because we don't think about our learning models, we need try something different to have different results. Think about the possibilities we have today if we use the digital tools that are available, we have the chance to create a model that really changes the way we learn things. Think about it.

Video games are very popular with children. However, some parents feel that video games can have a negative impact on their children, but others believe that they may have some positive effects. Like other things in life, playing video games has no positive or negative impact if used in moderation, let's share some examples: If you drink too much it will have a negative impact on your life, if you don't drink it will have a negative impact as well because you don't will have social interaction. On the one hand, if you watch the news every day, you will go crazy, on the other hand if you don't see any news, you will be uninformed. As you can see, when we talk about extreme behaviors, we are talking about problems and negative impacts in our life. The key is not playing video games and having positive or negative impact, the key is to balance usage to only have benefits without problems. Some parents argue that video games increase children's violent acts, but it has not been proven, some children have psychological problems that do not originate in video games, these children need to be treated as isolated cases and not as normal cases applied to everyone. Video games have been proven to improve brain activity and prevent some illnesses such as Ausimer and other neurological problems in old age. Video games are an entertainment tool and need be used as such. The only problem that video games can cause is the isolation that occurs when younger people use them for long hours a day, they become antisocial, and this is a real problem to be avoided by parents. As I said before, video games are not a problem as long as they are used sparingly.

Some people believe that zoos are good places for people to learn about animals, these people often think about the benefits to children of seeing live animals and improving their knowledge about the habits and behavior of animals. But these same people don't think about the animals' needs, capture and display an animal in a Zoo is cruel and needs to be banned by governments, it makes no sense to take an animal out the wild and put it in a jail for people to see it in one place. Other people believe that animals belong to nature and it is wrong to keep them in zoos. These people think that animals need to be free and humans don't have the right to to put them in jails just for fun. The problem with this point of view is the distance that will be created between people and animals. When people see wild animals, they commit to preserve them, and that is good for society and for the planet. I have no opinion about this thread because both arguments are good enough to convince me. I think we can adopt a middle term to benefit both sides of society, we can create zoos only with animals that cannot return to the wild, we can create rules to prevent the capture of wild animals and use the zoos as vet centers do treat the animals, in this way we will create a learning envoironment for humans and a recovery center for injured animals. What do you think about it?

When a student decides to study in a foreign country, many skills are improved, and many advantages are taken from this improvement in a foreign language, experience in other cultures, other people the student has met, and other advantages such as the ability to relate. The only disadvantage to studying in another country is the distance from home that makes the student feel separated from their family, and they have probably already missed many local events. I wish everyone could study in a foreign country, but it is not a reality for most people, in Brazil for example, only one percent of the population has access to a foreign university, in rare cases a poor person can travel to another country for studying. I had a particular experience studying in another country, I did my master's degree at a French university, and it was a momorable experience, I loved having contact with other cultures and different behaviors, when I taveled to France I didn't have enough ability to speak in English but that trip required me to study more and as result I am better in conversation and I am able to obtain positions in international companies. If you have the opportunity to study in a foreign country, don't think too much, just accept it and go ahead, you will enjoy the experience and remember it forever. If you don't have enough money to pay for a certain university, try taking language courses, they are cheaper than diplomas and you will experience another culture in the same way, with the same advantages.

Dear Sir, I am writing to complain to you about the ban you made public last month. I the last free months there is an issue that dominated among local people. To be more precise, the imposing of a ban on using of mobile phones on public transport system has made many people angry. Moreover, you also made public a ban on using mobile phones in shops and even expand the ban to restaurants. Firstly, the majority of locals were fed up with your regulations during the last two years. Instead of including your voters in a debate to find a solution how to tackle the problem, you always decide without thinking before. Personally, if I were in the position to give you an assessment, I would give you the lowest rank. Secondly, if we are calling for a better life in our town, we have to have the courage to tackle the problems and not to turn blind eyes to them. What I am trying to say is that locals had come with an idea and arranged a meeting to discuss it and find out a satisfactory outcome appropriate for both sides. Importantly, your presence in the meeting is more than important. So, on behalf of the locals, I am pleased to invite you to discuss our recommendations at the meeting, which is being held at the local pub on May 13th at 6 P.M. We are looking forward to seeing you there and I do hope, we finally find a solution to our common problem and contribute to a better life in our town. Yours sincerely,

Telling the truth is one of the ways of communication among people. However, some aspects have a major impact on our outcome. To give an illustration, the expression of the truth or a lie depends on if we are talking to an old person, the listener's mood, or even if we are subordinate to the listener we speak to at the moment. What is acceptable more to tell the truth or a lie? Firstly, before making a decision, to tell the truth, or a lie depends on how well we know the person who is listening to us. A good illustration of telling the truth is supported by our knowledge of the personality of the person we want to speak to. To be more precise, positive attitude and be in a balance with the person we decided to tell the truth. Conversely, we intentionally try to avoid telling lies. Instead, we are saying things differently or presenting them in a way that is not clear. As a result, it gives us a chance to put some arguments. The situation could turn against us if we intentionally lie on the first try. Telling the truth, or a lie depends on the situation and the receiver of our speech. We lie intentionally to avoid difficulties when we knew that our arguments would not be supported by an idea. In my view, it seems reasonable to consider the way we present that something is wrong. When I am in the position to choose the truth or a lie, I always try to see things from different angles, not to turn a blind eye to one side of it. Last but not least, the most important fact in interpersonal communication is to listen and show an interest. It is the most persuasive way to have positive communication and reach a result, which brings benefits on both sides.

Music is everywhere. Existing without the rhythm, sounds and beats of the music we love, cannot be defined as life. Living life to the fullest means transposing our emotions and feelings in notes, making them eternal. Music encapsulates most of our precious memories and unforgettable moments. Nothing compares to it. Music gives colour to our lives and it has therapeutic effects, calming and making us feel amused, fulfilled and reassured. It can be a safety valve, a safe anchor when you feel lonely and depressed. A melody is a great medium to better know and keep in contact with oneself, friends and family. Two people with similar tastes in music connect instantly. Those who are fond of playing the same instrument or have a flair for writing the same kind of poetry also get along really well. Music Helps Establish a Connection with Self Connecting with one’s inner self is an essential factor in leading a positive and wholesome life. The best way to go deep down and connect with oneself is through meditation. While many people try to meditate only a few are able to do it successfully. Most people find it hard to sit in silence and dive deep inside and thoughts usually make concentration impossible. Music can make this process easier. Music can calm the mind and help us to focus. There are many guided meditation audios and videos that can help you meditate with ease and develop a connection with your inner self. Music Helps Establish a Connection with Those Around Why do you think social gatherings have soft music being played in the background or a full-blown DJ installed? Well, this is because music has the power to build a positive atmosphere and connect strangers instantly. People often make new friends on the dance floor and music can be a tool to express inner emotions that words cannot do. Life without music would be empty, a vacuum that cannot be substituted by any other form of art. It can turn your sensations upside down and change the mood of your day. Every song I used to listen to in my childhood and girlhood keeps a treasure of unforgettable times and lifelong relationships.

Supporting young people to live an active life is much harder than it was 10 years ago or in my childhood. Many people suffer from not having an active lifestyle severe health problems like obesity. A good example is that children spend more time on social networks and by playing games on their mobile phones. Do our children need medication for their addiction to technology? I am in two minds about it. On one hand, in most cases, the technology is not on the blame. In early childhood, children are equipped with new technology. What is more, the natural environment in which young children grow and learn is intentionally replaced by the new technology. This artificial environment supports different stimuli of the brain. For instance, they do not think that doing sports activities is what they need. The simple reason for that is to get from their comfort zone. Getting out of their comfort zone represents effort and there is no persuasive argument to do it. Some individuals can see doing a sport as a way of relaxation of the body or the brain. Others just want to break their previous records. Sports activities provide satisfaction. Conversely, someone can feel it frustrating. On the other hand, technology can have a positive effect on our brains. As evidence of that is using technology as a tool of education. In my view, doing sport is an important part of our life. It makes us positive if we do some sport activity regularly. By and large, it keeps us in a good shape. For example, when we get older, we do not rely on others to give us a helping hand. As far as I am concerned, if I were in the position to change the lifestyle of the children from their childhood, I would have made it mandatory to do some sport based on your choice at least 3 times a week. No matter, how old the children are. It is our moral responsibility, to do something positive for the health of our children. Last but not least, it is not so late to act tomorrow.

Whether music is essential in our lives might appear like a completely vain question to be asking at first. However I'd like to dig deeper into this topic since I find music crucial for my life moreover I can't remember a day in which music hadn't been a part of. Ancient people used to make sounds which turned into melodies and created first music without even realizing it. There must have been a reason for coming up with a completely new thing such as music. Since then music has taken part in rituals, as celebration but even in comforting someone feeling blue. Needless to say never have I met a person who would have told me they didn't listen to any music. There is no need for a specific genre, every single person listens to something. They might even have access to the internet yet they involve music by simply singing some melodies in their daily lives. In conclusion yes I do believe music is necessary for our lives from making us feel understood in those lyrics of songs to motivating us during doing chores.

In my opinion, the opportunity to live on your own is amazing. I lived with my parents until I was eighteen years old and after that I ingressed university in another city and that is why I needed to live alone. I learned a lot from this situation, because you need to respect other people's space and they need to respect your space, other things like taking care of your money, feeding you, cleaning the house and studying alone and good to prepare you for the future , when you won't have your parents to look after you. I believe that people who don't experience these things will suffer more in the future with routine problems like work, wife or husband than people who lived alone during college phase. When you don't have your parents around, it's a great time to grow up and take charge of your life. Of course there are exceptions, I know some colleagues who studied with me and did not live with their parents and still grew up like me, but most colleagues who studied far from their parents grow up fast and after they finished the course at university they preferred to continue living on their own own. In my opinion, when you leave your parents' house and live alone, it's very difficult to go back and accept the rules that your parents want in their house, you want your space and your freedom and that's why you don't accept to return.

Dear Sam, I hope this email finds you well. As we both know, tomorrow we finally meet. It has been ages since I've seen you last time! I'm very glad that you found some time to share with me and we can have a little fun. Is 6:00 PM as a time for our meeting fine with you? I thought we could watch some movies like the old times, so if you have a favourite one you can bring it with you. I would really like to watch "Okja." It was hyped up by the media, but also praised by the fans for marvelous special effects. Also, if you could bring some snacks with you it would be great. I'm planning to prepare a hot meal (my specialty) and some cocktails. My house is at the corner of Franciszkanska and Mlynarska streets. It's next to the big clothing store, so I'm sure you will find it easily. Though if you had any problems finding the way, do not hesitate to just call me. I hope to see you soon. Love, D.

Sam, I´m looking forward to receive you in my house tomorrow. I was thinking of all of the fun things that we could do. I thought that we could play different board games or try some new video games. Maybe we could do them both too. If it does not rain, we should also go outside and play soccer and basketball with my neighbours. They are really cool and easy to be with. So, I think you fit in just as fast as I did. You probably have some ideas too, so we can share it and make this day a perfect one. You can come right after the lunch if your parents agree with it, of course. You don´t need to bring much, just your clothes and the toothbrush. That´s all. I´m not sure how well you know my location, so here are some tips of how to get here. I am pretty sure that you are familiar with the John´s market. So, you will have to turn right after this market and then you´ll gonna count three traffic lights. After, you will turn left, left and right. My house it´s at the closed condominium called Bright Garden. When you get here, just text me and I will receive you at the front. If you have any doubts, just called me and I will try to help you.

How music is important in our lives? I think music is very important in our lives. Do you know when we are a kid, we were listened to the llulaby to fall asleep. When we are from 3 to 5 years old, we learn music from school. When we are teens we listen to music every day. Pop, rock, edm, classical,.... many type of music for every one. Music is a different way to tell a story. Anthem music is a story about a country. Love music is a story about love. It doesn't matter when the music is appear, the story still have this meaning. Some music make us feel enthusiasm, some music make us feel bad, some make us relax. Do you ever imagine what were the world be like without music? I can't imagine that. The life will very bored.

My favourite food is the home-made pizza, I love it because it is my father that makes it, but we usually eat it once a week and that is very sad. We usually eat it on Saturdays for dinner but sometimes it can be Sunday instead. I love it because the ingredients are all home made and I like how my father makes the dough with a lot of cheese and a lot of bacon.

To start a discussion about the problem of doctors not going to rural areas, we first need to talk about a common behavior shared by all humans beings. Is a main knowledge that our parents teach us since our childhood to be the best person as possible in our lives, it's not unusual for everyone learn things such as the importance of the money to have a good or a comfortable life, we learn to valorize our time to achieve the better position as possible. So, when talk about the medical doctos who choose a comfortable life in the city, where they can earn more money, it easy to understand why they choose this option. if I were in the same position I will choose the same option. When we think about our life-time, we remember that our life is limited, we have a certain quantity of time to spend, and we need to spend this time in the more intelligent way as possible. There are more people living in cities than in rural areas, people who live in cities are more richer than people who live in rural ares, for this reason is not rational choose live in another place. In my opinion, the reasons which made doctors choose live in cities than in rural areas is only rational. It's not normal to choose a worse option if you have a better one. But, it is not a rule, there are some medical doctors who choose live in rural ares, these professionals don't need a lot of money. they just want to help poor people or they want to have a peaceful live living in a place just for lifestyle. To sum up, I think this is a personal choose, us as humans and individuals need choose ehat is better for us, despite other opinions.

When we talk about offices, we nearly always think of a large room located in a new office building in the center of a city, but this way of thinking is just a stereotype, in many cases the offices are located in places that cannot have the correct infraestructure that the company needs to operateo or they just want this location as a strategic option. We cannot determine a single layout for all offices because companies have different realities, some companies need an open plan office for their employees, other companies want different and separate spaces to have more control over interactions for security reasons or for commecial reasons. In my opinion, the reality of work is dramatically changing after Covid-19, many people around the world have found a new way of working, they have been starting work from home and enjoyed it, I don't think offices will ever be the same as before as of 2020, people today feel more comfortable working from home, and this workforce behavior is a challenge to traditional business models that force their employees to return to the office. Many people won't go back to their old model. We have two main differences in the office work model, the first is a model that involves knowledge, for this type of professional, sharing information and experience is more important than working hard alone, the other type of workforce is that people who work on bureaucractic tasks that don't change or that don't require creativity, this type of person can work alone for many hours and have no problem with it. Despite the models we have, one thing is very important today, companies need to find a way of working that improves the quality of life of their employees. They need to define this as a common goal for the company.

Some high schools require students to complete a certain amount of volunteer work in order to graduate. In my opinion this is a good way to improve students skills, with this hands-on volunteering experience they will learn about the importance of charity and be more socialized professionals compared to students who do not have the same experience. When students participate in charitable actions, they learn how important it is to society as a whole, a person who has enough time, energy and money to volunteer in any activity, will be more respected and recognized than others who have the same opportunity and don't use it to improve. When high schools require students volunteer for some local work, they are not just trying to improve the quality of life for the poor, they are trying spread good deeds and create empathize with students. A person who grows knowing how other people need their help will work better in team member than students who are more antisocial, volunteering is good for everyone, students have a lot of free time and could use that time to do something important. When an employer sees volunteer work on a resumé, he immediately recognizes the importance of that person who is trying to get a job with him, I have no doubt that that task is important for the lives of the next generations, they will grow up with fundamental values that will change our society to a better way than we have improved at this time. This kind of requirement must be mandatory in every high schools in every country in the world, this process would certainly make our world a better place to live.

A common topic when we talk about schools requirements is music class, this is controversial and divides opinions between parents and students. Despite the nobli goal involved in this requirement, some people are not able to play any musical instrument or don't feel comfortable to attend a class where they are obliged to learn how to play a musical instrument. There are schools where students must attend music classes, in other they may not be required, and in some schools may be no music classes at all, in my opinion, schools should offer the possibility to attend a music class, but it should be optional and not a requirement. I will use my example to explain my own point of view, today I'm thirdy years old and don't play any musical instrument. This is not a ploblem to me because I used my time to learn things that is useful to me, for me know how to play a musical instrument is not an important thing and I'm happy with this decision. If I had been forced to attend a music class when I was at school I certainly would have hated it. Although this arguments, I think music class is an important thing to students who want to learn how to play some instrument. I just think these classes may not be a requirement, it might be optional. Music as art is important for our society, there are many people around the world that love playing music and this is not a ploblem, music is a fuel for our mind, the majority of people listen to music every day and this show how important it is for humanity. To sum up, just learn what make you happy, don't worry if you are not able to play an instrument, just learn how to do it.

When we are undergraduates, we are just at the beginning of our life, we don't know many things and we are experiencing new realities, feelings and living new moments that build our personality over time. Some students move and live alone wile others choose to live at home with their family, let's talk about these two options. Both options have vantagens and disadvantages, the first option improve more experiences to students than the second one, when students decide to live in a campus or rent an apartment close to the university, they will learn how the adult live is, they will understand a reality that was different that they have in their parents' house, they will learn things that only the life impose to them. Live alone is a challenge for everyone, but is a great moment when they can grow faster. The second option is more comfortable, when a student keep living at parents' house during college time, they will save more money compared to move away to live in their own. In contrast, many opportunities and experiences will be lost comparatively. Another advantage of living with parents is the fact that they have more free time to focus on the subjects they need learn. Both options are good, sometimes a student doesn't have the option to choose, a student must live with his parents because he hasn't enough money to live by herself for example, sometimes, the parents' house is very far from the university that student must move away to live closer and spent less time and money. Despite the options, the most important thing for students is not this short time they will live with parents or not, what matters is learn new things and be happy with what they have at the moment.

I want a calm and long life than a short and intense one, I prefer staying at home than partying, I pay more to relax than to have adventures. This is me, and this is how I think about having a happier life. I love studying and sometimes I get immersed in reading a book, if I need to choose between a quiet place to stay for the weekend and a place full of people like a beach, I'll definitely choose the first option. I don't judge people who like noise and overcrowded parties but in my opinion this is not something to do every weekend, life is more than that. If you are involved in noise and have a lot of intense days, you'll never think about important things, you need some time to reflect on important matters, get to know yourself more deeply and relax, take it easy, life is not something you can use intensively, you need to balance your rountine to achieve a healthier way of life. I would like to live a long and peaceful life until 100 years old, some people will argue that this living model is not exciting, but I would argue that is exactly what I want. I work every day for one reason, I work because I need money to retire as quickly as possible to enjoy life as slowly as possible. Use your time conscientiously, you only have one chance in this world, don't reduce your time on earth, take this recommendations and you will enjoy the journey.

It is impossible to always tell the truth, if we think about our daily activities we'll realize that we tell little lies to ourselves. It's normal to tell lies to other people, what we need to avoid is telling lies that will harm others, this needs to be avoided. We have two different types of lies, the small, safete lie and the big, harmful lie. The first is used when we need help someone to be happier, for example, when you wife asks you if she was fat, you are going to lie obviously, this lie is not a problem for society, it is used to make your wife happier and have no harmful consequences. Problems occur when you use a big harmful lie, sometimes we use this mechanism to gain benefits for ourselves and in many cases this lie will harm other people, it is a painless gain. In my opinion, liying is a natural and implicit act of humans being, we need to use it with caution and think about the possible results of our lie will have in the bahavior of others, if a lie is discovered people will no longer trust us. Keep a lie hidden is difficult, in some point the lie will be discovered and we need be prepared to face the consequences. To summarize, I think our world is full of lies, every person lies to us at some point, so the best we can do is accepted and work to identify when a lie is told.

Sometimes there are people who ask themselves if music is important in our lives, and without any doubt the answer is yes. Music is present in the most of events in our lives, for example when we are celebrating a wedding, the most important situation is the dance between the couple. When we are celebrating, a bad song could make stop the party or a good song could increase the fun. In general, life without music would be very bored, when I am with friends I usually say "if the music didn't exist, I would have to invent it," and this is true. in my personal case, I listen to music every day, when I train, I listen to music, when I drive, I listen to music.

In my opinion,l think learning to speak a foreign lauguage is not as important these days as it was in the past. Now let me tell you why. In the early 1500s-1700s,the English got off to a late start with the whole colonizing thing. They want to expand their territory. They watched as Spain and Portugal quickly snapped up land in the Americas during the 1500s. And made a fortune on gold,silver,and sugar. Plus,English's a long time Enemy,the French,were starting to explore the north. So the English wondered if they should start colonizing too. But There's a problem,if they want to colonizing,they had to know a lot about the places they're going to colonize. If they don't,they might fail to make some deals with the native people in the South. So the king authorized a public studying class to let the sailors know where they are sailing to,what their culture is,and how to communicate in their language. But the native American's didn't speak an easy language,so it takes months to know the basics of it. Back to the present,we don't need a lot of effort trying to know what someone's saying. We just take out our phones and download a translator. Easy-peasy.

Nowadays, we spend most of our life is spent working at the office. Therefore, it might be utterly useful to analyze which model of office it is better to achieve the huge goals enterprises face in this tough times. In the following lines I will discuss this issue. On the one hand, it is pretty common to watch people working in enclosed cublicles . Rarely do we find work place where employees can work in large and pleasant offices like Google ones. Despite the evidence that this open design offices empower the productivity of enterprises, it seems to me so hard to find something like this in our cities. On the other hand, it is widely known that workers can perform better if their employer give them such a comfortable space to work where they are able to see what is going on in the office. As far as I am concerned, feeling being part of the company, workers will give their best to carry on with the daily affair of enterprise. In brief, unless we absolutely change the way we work and where we work it will be hardly difficult to improve the workers life. Hence, it is imperative to reconsider the design of our offices. In this case, I totally believe that open design offices are a good deal better than classical ones. To sum up, I vividly believe that it is time to keep our offices up to date and redesign our work places in order to make them more practical and useful to twenty first thentury needs.

Aiming at high moral values has long been regarded as a hallmark of a modern, sensible human being. That feature alone accounts for our perception of moral superiority. Thus, it is not nonsensical to deduce that deprived of spirituality, moral challenges, and reliability, human beings find themselves threatened in their core values. Does really life revolve all about meeting basis needs? Absolutely not. On the face of it it seems that truthfulness is a baseline for all successful human interactions, yet, after close examination an entirely ifferent picture emerges. What if benefits of fibbing or even downright deception overhaul perks of truthfulness? Let's take a closer look at a handful of instances in which this is the case ranging from heartbreaking home truths, terminal illness, brutal truth of life to an item of apparently neutral information potentially capable of wrecking havoc and destabilise human lives. Yes, in order for a person to thrive it is permissible to sift, omit, or bent the hash truth. It falls within the guidelines for affection to a friend claim. A different approach entails going around the houses and attempting to avoid the burning issues. Instead of a full-fledged condemnation, a softer approach is advisable in order for the interlocutor not to feel threatened. Once in a while simply omitting a fact might potentially give rise to enhanced communication between the parts. But is it worth it? There is no a black and white answer to this question.

Dear Mayor, I am writing in reference to the supposed proprosal of the banning of the use of mobile phones in certain public spaces of our beloved town. As far as I am concerned, this sort of decisions should be discussed with citizens after taking such an important and shocking decision which I totally believe it will have a dramatic impact on our daily live. Firstly, I can come to imagine which sorts of security problems our town council want to solve. Seldom do we find someone who is not watching the screen while he is walking or at the bus. Definitely, avoiding the use of mobile phones in certain public areas, our town will be a more secure one. However, I am not quite sure if it will be the best chance to fix this issue. Secondly, I reckon that our society needs to disconnect but I consider that this sort of measures are outside the law. In fact, I wonder if it is constitucional. Despite this sort of gadgets can have a negative impact on our society, they had proved to be utterly useful. Therefore, banning them can be not only a catastrophic decision but an inconstitucional one. In brief, we need to change ourselves in order to mend this huge issue. All in all, it is an individual problem with social repercusions. As a result, I consider that another type of measures are needed if we want to improve our city and to boost our quality of life. Thank you for considering my application. Kind regards.

My favourite season of the year. My favourite season of the year is winter and now, on January, we are in the middle of the winter. I like the most because in winter, you can wear warm clothes, we enjoy the fires in the fireplaces, we have the Christmas holidays and if we have a family, we can spend time with our families. I prefer winter instead of summer because you can do many activities without the hot of summer, when some activities are dangerous, like sports. There are activities that you only can do in winter like skiing, snowboarding, and others. In winter, cities are beautiful, the streets and stores put their Christmas decoration and walking there is fun and beauty. Some people say that summer is better, but I strongly believe that I have waited a lot of time to be in winter and definitely, I am going to enjoy all the fun, food and time that the winter gives me. Finally, I would like to tell you something, if you don't enjoy the winter, it is because you are not doing the things in a correct way. I wish you a happy winter.

Nowadays, it is often said telling the truth is always such an important issue, but it has ever been telling lies an option. On the one hand, telling the truth, you will never be worried about what you have said. Therefore, it is highly possible you would be more confident, if you had not told any lies in your life. But seldom do we find people of that kind. However, you could be in trouble as long as you tell the truth. Unfoutunatly it is being widely known how dangerous a situation could be when you tell the wrong person what he is not willing to hear. On the other hand, lying may save you in some context from worst consequences. Despite it is impossible to lie the rest of your life, lying would be utterly useful in certain situations such as when you were a child and you had not do your homework. However, fourtunately, in other major issues where a lot of diverse and different interests are in play, people generally get caught when they say a lie. But, sadly, telling lies, you cannot only hurt yourself but other people feelings. To sum up, I vividly believe lying should never be acceptable as far as it can cause a negative impact in other people's life. As far as I am concerned, we must be the only responsables of our actions and hence of our lies.

Ed Sheraan has performed there for awhile and then came my favorite one Shawn Mendes, he performed for a whole hour! For me that was the happiest hour of the entire day! Then there was a band that I didn't know but their music is so optimistic and full of life, I really love it. Secondly, even though the concert was very crowded yet it was so safe, there was security members every where and they were making sure there's a safe environment for us all. They checked our bags carefully at the entrance and they took every toothy thing and they also took fireworks because as you know, there was a lot of problems because of fireworks at the last concert, so they were making sure everything is safe inside this time. I really hoped you were there with me, you would have enjoyed a lot! But it's fine we will go together to the next one so make sure you put that in your schedule from now. Have a nice day Sam! Yours, Sophia

Telling the truth has been always considered to many people that are very good people and they in all occasions tell the truth about everything, but.... Is always telling the truth the best option? Telling the truth is one of the best options, but not in everything, if you gotta tell that for example, a dog of a person has died and he/she is asking you and you know what happened, you can tell him/her that his/her dog has disappeared to don't make them very sad about their dog has died, but not always telling a lie to try to " fix " something could fix that, it could end up in a very very bad situation, as an example, you can tell that you didn't break up that jar, but if your mother believes it, she then will go to ask your brother/sister, then to your father and then they will ask you to tell what you saw, and if you lied the punishment of breaking a jar will be bigger as you lied to them too. What you can do to prevent those scenarios you could take like 10 seconds to analyse the question they did to you to think about " shall I tell the truth? Or a little lie? " then you can say the best option, but in the scenario you couldn't think about it you can just say " I don't know "

Nowadays, as long as we fourtunately have more free time, one issue has become really important to consider, namely: how we want to live our lives? On the one hand, living such a calm and relaxing life, you will probably live until 100 years. However, despite living a large life could have its advantages, I sincerely believe it will tragically end up by being depressing. Not only because it is unnatural not to feel that way after all those years, but also because it will be severe and ruthless. Living more than your reslatives, it is a harsh punishment as long as you see your relatives die. On the other hand, having a large life, it is not required in order to have a pleintful life. As far as I am concerned, living an intense live, you will wisely appreciate every single second of your existence. What is more, you will be sufficiently free to do whatever you want with your life as long as you know you will die. Only when we understand our temporary existence, we will be able to move forward and live our dreams. In brief, unless you want to have a bored existence, I will highly recommend you to be as active as possible in your daily life. A lot has to change in ourselves in order to live the way we dream. To sum up, I totally believe an intense life it is a good deal better than a long and bored life.,

I like to sleep with a small light on and there's no noise. I sleep at least 7 hours and if I sleep less than that then I feel unwell for the whole day. That's why I like to sleep for 7-8 hours a day. Even during the day I like to take power naps for 30-45 minutes. I do not like to sleep even in a room with a lot of noise. I like to sleep in a very quiet place with good vibes.

What is my favourite season? This is a very good issue and answering it is not simple. However, my favourite season is autumn. I love autumn because it is a season of change. I can see the changing all around me. The temperature is warm and the sun is not so hot. The days are short and the sun goes down early. I can see the changing on the trees. The leaves change their color from green to different shades of red like orange, yellow and brown. And the leaves on the trees are less, they fall down and cover streets, gardens or paths. The mountains are whole colored. I like this season because I can stay at home with a hot cup of tea and read a book while the weather outside is bad. On this season I love to go out with friends or go out for a short running session with my boyfriend. I love feel the cold breeze on my face. I like to go to the mountain searching for mushrooms. And what about yours? What is your favourite season?

I recently discovered Write and Improve, a new writing tool for English learners that is easy to use and helps you write better. The main features of the tool are many tasks that you can use to write texts and submit them for correction, the application identifies what is wrong and make recommendations to improve your writing. This tool is useful because you can see recommendations in real time, show you a grid with IELTS scale and the position of your text between levels A1 to C2. It shows the words that are wrong and the tasks have different levels, you can start at Beginner level, advance to intermediate and advanced level. There are tasks to improve your business writing and new tasks are added monthly. One thing I like about the tool is the option to write the task I want, I don't have to do all the intermediary tasks to go to the advanced level for example. I have some difficulties and I miss some resources like tips to use in my texts like the right use of collocations, how can I improve my sentences and resources to help me create better phrases. Some recommendations to improve the tool include: More rewards to engage the writer, tips to help with writing, a graphic with filters to show all our progress through the levels and a personalized study plan. Maybe we can have a guide to compare our writing evolution to some guide ruler, are we on the right path or not?

Hello, I heard about a plan to ban mobile phones on public transport and in shops and restaurants, who has this idea? I ask because there is no possibility what people will not use their mobile phones in these places. What was the person proposing this thinking? Today we use our smartphone to do many things, some people pay for public transport with an app, use virtual reality to try on clothes and use their cameras to access restaurant menus through QR codes displayed on the tables. there are no laws that will restrict the use of smartphones anywhere, there is only one place where people don't use their smartphones, I'm talking about high secure areas where these devices are restricted by law. If the intent of this plan is to reduce mobile phones use to improve people's quality of life, banning it is not the right answer. We need teach people about the health problems that using their smarphones for loung hours cause on their health, we can establish rules of social behavior for some places, not to force people do what we want, but to achieve our goals by doing with people choosing themselves correct behavior in those places. We just have to make suggestions to create the right culture, people's habits will change naturally to suit the local culture. This is the right way to influence them to do what we want.

If you can pick up the mail from our mailbox, we will be very grateful, but only once in a blue moon, not daily.

Nowadays we have many resources on the Internet to practise our English skills, in my personal opinion the hardest part to practise is writing, where you have to be very carefully and imaginative and where each fail can cost a lot. One of the best tools that the students have to practise this skill is a website called "Write and Improve," where I have been doing a lot of exercises. It is a website where you can practise a lot, and receive good inputs. You can start from a very low level, to break the ice, until a very hard level, where you would have to be an expert in this subject. It is said that the good things are expensive, but in this case, another advantage could be that this website is totally free, you will only have to register in the website and enjoy learning. On the other hand, this website has some disadvantages in its use, for instance the corrections are made by a machine, and it could not be perfect, leaving some fails without correction, or giving wrong feedback. The fact is that a native teacher is much better to learn a language, but not all of us can afford a teacher, for that reason even with those possibilities I continue recommend you this website. Finally, I strongly believe that the advantages are much better than the disadvantages and if you use this website, you will find many useful resources.

Currently, many things have been replaced by machines, and we agree with this fact. Although, there has been a debate about replacing student's books and workbooks in our whole student system. On the one hand, almost everyone has electrical devices such as tablets, laptops, ... that could led to a new advanced world where we can learn with the latest studies and discoveries, making the study harder, but more accurate, without fails. When we use these electrical devices we don't cut trees, we can use these devices with multiple purposes, we can enjoy our learning watching videos, listening to audios, ... and if we use clean energy and buy good products, we can learn without damaging the environment. On the other hand, if we only used these products, books could be disappeared in a short time, and they have many advantages, they are even a form of art that we have had for centuries. We have to avoid that this form of art become extint, but for that purpose we have libraries, museums and other. Finally, taking all the previous ideas into account, I really think that electrical devices have to replace books and notebooks, but we have to preserve books, because they are part of our history

I watch web series in my free time and I do this only at the weekend. I see there are real life situations where if any one facing some issues they can overcome fear of failure after watching web series and it totally based on real life examples, so any one can relate to their daily life situations. After watching this type of things we know about society and our country also becasue we do not visit all the state of a country so we don't know what is happen in those states of a country. So, web series are the good source to be aware people about the real life situations. Last time I watched 'Family Man'. I learnt so many things about the real life situations that I can face in future. So if I am aware from the situations and it happened then we do not take much stress about that situation. So I think web series are the best shows to be aware people about the real life situations.

First of all, we live in a world where each day we are more connected than the previous day, because of that the more languages we learn, the best for these connections.

Secondly, there are a very small group of people with a very particular way of thinking, these people believe that if they are not going to travel abroad, they don't need to learn a foreign language, but you don't need to learn a language because of that, you might need or work for people who don't speak your language in your own country. if you did that you would lose amazing opportunities in your life, opportunities like work in top companies, having the latest gadgets at your sector and a huge amount of varieties. Finally, I can say that I have needed several times a foreign language in my work and I'm very happy to say that I could do the task thanks to it. learning a language could be seen as having a mountain to climb, but when you break the ice with the language it will be as a cup of tea.
