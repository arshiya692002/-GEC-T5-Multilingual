## SweLL-gold: the Swedish Learner Language corpus

The SweLL-gold corpus consists of 502 pseudonymized essays written by adult learners of Swedish. 
The corpus is described in [Volodina et al. (2019)](https://nejlt.ep.liu.se/article/view/1374), with statistics and metadata provided [here](https://spraakbanken.github.io/swell-release-v1/Metadata-SweLL).

Original essays have been corrected with a minimal target hypothesis in mind, i.e. changing the original wording and structure as little as possible to retain the learner language for research. 
Detailed instructions on normalization are provided in [Rudebeck, Sundberg and Wir√©n (2021)](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/69432).
In addition, both original and corrected essays are semi-automatically pseudonymized.
Other than that, texts are unedited.

The MultiGEC version of the corpus has been obtained via the [multigec.py script](https://github.com/spraakbanken/SweLL-scripts/blob/main/multigec.py), available as part of [a larger collection of SweLL preprocessing scripts](https://github.com/spraakbanken/SweLL-scripts).
