# Overview

MERLIN is an error-annotated written learner corpus for German, Italian and Czech. It was created within the MERLIN project (2012-2014). The texts in MERLIN were taken from standardized language tests and are methodologically precisely related to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe 2001, 2020). 

The corpus is described in Wisniewski et al. (2013) and Boyd et al (2014).

The full complement of 1033 German learner essays is accompanied by  minimaltarget hypotheses (TH1). A subset of 275 essays also  features an extended target hypothesis (TH2).  The latter set is  not part of the Multigec-2025 shared task.

The two levels of target hypotheses are inspired by the Falko corpus.  The  minimal target hypothesis is intended to fix orthographic and grammatical errors (TH1)  while the extended target hypothesis (TH2) also  addresses sociolinguistic, lexical, and pragmatic deviations from what would be expected from native speakers.

The guidelines for creating the Merlin target hypotheses are included in the overall MERLIN Annotation Structure Guidelines document.

The data splits used for the Merlin corpus are taken from earlier work by Adriane Boyd (http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6111 ; https://github.com/adrianeboyd/boyd-wnut2018).
