## Latvian Language Learner Corpus (LaVA)

The corpus includes more than 1000 texts created by foreign Latvian language learners studying at Latvian higher education institutions for the first or second semester. The morphologically annotated texts have been checked manually; the language learners' errors have been manually annotated.

Some personal information is censored, replacing the word with asterisk \(\*\).
