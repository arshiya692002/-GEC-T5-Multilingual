## IceL2EC: the Icelandic L2 Error Corpus

The Icelandic L2 Error Corpus (IceL2EC) is a collection of texts in modern Icelandic, written by adult learners of Icelandic as a second language. They have been annotated for mistakes related to spelling, grammar, and other issues. Each mistake is marked according to error type using an error code, so that the original corpus consists of 101 files with 24,948 categorized error instances. 
The corpus is described in [Glisic & Ingason(2022)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361876310_The_Nature_of_Icelandic_as_a_Second_Language_An_Insight_from_the_Learner_Error_Corpus_for_Icelandic), with corpus data provided [here](https://repository.clarin.is/repository/xmlui/handle/20.500.12537/280).

Original essays have been corrected and annotated by professional linguists, annotating both for grammatical error correction and fluency. Each edit was manually classified into 6 main error type categories with 258 specific error codes in total.
