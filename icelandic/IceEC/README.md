# Icelandic Error Corpus (IceEC)

The Icelandic Error Corpus (IceEC) is a collection of texts in modern Icelandic annotated for mistakes related to spelling, grammar, and other issues. The texts are organized by genre, which include sentences from highschool student essays, online news texts and Wikipedia articles. The version included in MultiGEC-2025 is the subset of student essays. Sentences within texts in the student essays had to be shuffled due to the license which they were originally published under, but neither the online news texts nor the Wikipedia articles needed to be shuffled.
