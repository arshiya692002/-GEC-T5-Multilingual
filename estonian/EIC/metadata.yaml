source_corpus: Estonian Interlanguage Corpus (EIC)
learner_type: L2
short_description: This error-annotated subcorpus includes narrative/descriptive and argumentative writings, informal and formal letters representing the proficiency levels A2â€“C1. The texts are annotated in the M2 format, each sentence can have up to 3 annotation versions. This material has been used to develop and test Estonian autocorrection tools. Here, it is split into a train, dev and test set because other Estonian MultiGEC resources do not contain C1-level writings.
