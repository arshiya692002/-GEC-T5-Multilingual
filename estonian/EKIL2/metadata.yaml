learner_type: L2 
short_description:  The corpus has been automatically generated from the Error-annotated Estonian L2 learner corpus. The materials for the error annotated corpus are based on the Estonian learner corpus EMMA, containing an Estonian learner assessment test (7th grade, 254 texts), basic school final exam (9th grade, 251 texts) and state exam data (12th grade, 998 texts) from the Education and Youth Board. The error-annotation has been carried out by applying an ERRANT-M2 annotation scheme, adapted to the Estonian specifics. The corpus includes for all of the original and two reference sets a total of 1,503 essays of A2, B1 and B2 level in subsets of 1202-150-151 for train, dev and test. The reference sets are differentiated by the basis of whether optional error corrections are taken into account or not.

#Additional info about reference corpora 

#The error-annotated source material includes a category of the error correction being optional. If false, as in most cases, then the correction is mandatory. If marked true, then the error correction is optional. 

#The ref1 and ref2 sets represent the different handling of this category. The ref1 sets have been generated by taking into account all error corrections, regardless of them being mandatory or optional. In ref2 set only mandatory error corrections have been taken into account.
