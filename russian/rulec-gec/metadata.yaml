short_description: RULEC-GEC contains data from essays written by L2 learners of Russian and Russian heritage speakers studying at the University of Oregon. The essay corpus is referred to as "RULEC", and the annotated subset that is distributed is referred to as RULEC-GEC. The annotated data includes "text snippets", i.e. consecutive sentences extracted and corrected from a subset of essays. Note that the majority of text snippets do not include an entire essay, but only a subset of sentences that appear consecutively in an essay. Sentences that do not appear consecutively in the original essay are represented by separate snippets in the data.
