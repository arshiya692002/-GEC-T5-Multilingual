## Greek Learner Corpus II (GLCII)

The Greek Learner Corpus II (GLCII) corpus includes a written and a spoken part. Our dataset is limited to the 1289 written essays produced by L2 Greek language learners enrolled in various higher education institutions in Greece and abroad. The essays have been corrected by members of the contribution team. Currently, the GLCII is the largest publicly available Learner Corpus (LC) of L2 Greek, compiled within the framework of the research project [Latent Aspects in L2 Acquisition (LAL2A)](http://lal2a.lit.auth.gr/) funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research & Innovation (HFRI). The names used by learners at the end of some essays are pseudonyms, not their real names.
A significant part of the corpus has been error-annotated. The annotated portion is also available via a web application called [GLC Gateway](https://glc.lit.auth.gr/app/GLC_Gateway).
